Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114 improves eating behaviors and mood-related factors in adults with overweight during weight loss: a randomized controlled trial.

Background: Gut microbiota has emerged as a modifiable factor influencing obesity and metabolic diseases. Interventions targeting this microbial community could attenuate biological and psychological comorbidities of excess weight. Objective: Our aim was to determine if Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114 supplementation accentuated beneficial impact of weight loss on metabolic and cognitive health. Methods: This 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed biological markers of energy metabolism, eating behaviors and mood-related factors in 152 adults with overweight receiving L. rhamnosus HA-114 supplementation or placebo, that were also on a dietary intervention inducing a controlled weight loss. Results: Although probiotic supplementation did not potentiate the reduction in body weight or fat mass, a significant decrease in plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides was observed in the probiotic-supplemented group only. With respect to eating behaviors and mood-related factors, beneficial effects were either observed only in the group receiving probiotic supplementation or were significantly greater in this group, including decrease in binge eating tendencies, disinhibition and food-cravings. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the clinical relevance of probiotic supplementation to induce beneficial metabolic and psychological outcomes in individuals with overweight undergoing weight loss.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02962583.
