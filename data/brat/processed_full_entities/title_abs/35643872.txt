Effects of enriched seafood sticks (heat-inactivated B. animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145, inulin, omega-3) on cardiometabolic risk factors and gut microbiota in abdominally obese subjects: randomized controlled trial.

PURPOSE: To assess the effects of enriched seafood sticks with postbiotic and bioactive compounds on CMD risk factors and the gut microbiota in abdominally obese individuals. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial with abdominally obese individuals. Participants (n = 120) consumed 50 g/day of enriched seafood sticks containing SIAP: (1010 colony forming units (CFUs) of heat-inactivated B. animalis subsp. lactis CECT8145, 370 mg/day omega 3 and 1.7 g/day inulin), or 50 g/day of placebo seafood sticks for 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, an acute single-dose study of 4 h was performed. RESULTS: Sustained SIAP2 consumption significantly decreased the insulin by - 5.25 mg/dL and HOMA-IR (homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) by - 1.33. In women, SIAP2 consumption significantly decreased the pulse pressure (PP) by - 4.69 mmHg. Gut microbiota analysis showed a negative association between glycemic parameter reduction and Alistipes finegoldii and Ruminococcaceae, and between PP reduction and Prevotella 9-ASV0283 and Christensenellaceae. In the acute single dose-study 4-h, SIAP2 consumption produced a lower increase in the postprandial circulating triglyceride levels [23.9 (7.03) mg/dL (mean [standard error])] than the observed with placebo [49.0 (9.52)] mg/dL. CONCLUSION: In abdominally obese individuals, enriched seafood sticks induce a potential protection against type 2 diabetes development by the reduction in the insulin and HOMA-IR; and in cardiovascular disease, in women, by the PP reduction. These effects are accompanied by partial changes in the gut microbiota composition. The enriched seafood sticks reduce the atherogenic triglyceride postprandial concentrations. Our results support the use of enriched seafood sticks as a complementary strategy in the management of CMD risk factors. REGISTRATION NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIAL: ( www.
