Digestion characteristics of polysaccharides from Gracilaria lemaneiformis and its interaction with the human gut microbiota.

The health effects of polysaccharides have attracted lots of attention, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study indicated that polysaccharides from Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GLPs) tolerated the conditions of mouth, stomach, and small intestine, and it reached the colon integrally, where it increased the production of short chain fatty acids, altered the gut microbiota, and especially increased the level of Bacteroides. To explore the underlying mechanism, hundreds of Bacteroides strains were isolated from the human feces and identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. It showed that Bacteroides species profile was different between individuals, revealing an inherent difference in the human gut microbiota. The use of Bacteroides on GLPs was species-dependent, and various small molecular GLPs fragments can be liberated from growth of Bacteroides species. On the other hand, Bacteroides species that unable to grow with GLPs can live in GLPs-derived fragments, forming a GLPs utilization network. It should be noted that small molecular GLPs fragments can be easier to be metabolized by intestinal microbes and have better effect on cellular response. It suggested that the effect of polysaccharides cannot only be attributed to modulation of the gut microbiota, but also associated with the effect of microbial degradation on GLPs own activities.
