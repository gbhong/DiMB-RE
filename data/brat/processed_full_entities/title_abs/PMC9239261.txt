Highly Specialized Carbohydrate Metabolism Capability in Bifidobacterium Strains Associated with Intestinal Barrier Maturation in Early Preterm Infants

ABSTRACT
“Leaky gut,” or high intestinal barrier permeability, is common in preterm newborns. The role of the microbiota in this process remains largely uncharacterized. We employed both short- and long-read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomes to characterize the intestinal microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of 113 preterm infants born between 240/7 and 326/7 weeks of gestation. Enabled by enhanced taxonomic resolution, we found that a significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacterium breve and a diet rich in mother’s breastmilk were associated with intestinal barrier maturation during the first week of life. We combined these factors using genome-resolved metagenomics and identified a highly specialized genetic capability of the Bifidobacterium strains to assimilate human milk oligosaccharides and host-derived glycoproteins. Our study proposes mechanistic roles of breastmilk feeding and intestinal microbial colonization in postnatal intestinal barrier maturation; these observations are critical toward advancing therapeutics to prevent and treat hyperpermeable gut-associated conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
