Dynamics of Changes in the Gut Microbiota of Healthy Mice Fed with Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria

Probiotics are living microorganisms that provide numerous health benefits for their host. Probiotics have various effects on the body; for example, they change gut microbiota, improve the integrity of the epithelial barrier and have anti-inflammatory effects. The use of probiotic supplements that are based on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria is one of the approaches that are used to balance gut microflora. In our study, we evaluated the effects of supplements, which were based on members of the Lactobacillaceae family and bifidobacteria, on the gut microbiome of healthy mice using the 16S rRNA sequencing method. The data that were obtained demonstrated that when mice received the probiotic supplements, statistically significant changes occurred in the composition of the microbiome at the phylum level, which were characterized by an increase in the number of Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria, all of which have potentially positive effects on health. At the generic level, a decrease in the abundance of members of the Nocardioides, Helicobacter and Mucispirillum genus, which are involved in inflammatory processes, was observed for the group of mice that was fed with lactic acid bacteria. For the group of mice that was fed with bifidobacteria, a decrease was seen in the number of members of the Tyzzerella and Akkermansia genus. The results of our study contribute to the understanding of changes in the gut microbiota of healthy mice under the influence of probiotics. It was shown that probiotics that are based on members of the Lactobacillaceae family have a more positive effect on the gut microbiome than probiotics that are based on bifidobacteria.
