Out of the 34 infants screened, 32 were enrolled (mean age 18.6 weeks; range 4–37; 20 (62.5%) male). Twenty-nine infants completed the trial to the primary endpoint (V4). The study flow is summarized in Figure 1. Demographics and clinical details of infants at the time of enrollment are summarized in Table 1.
3.1. Clinical Presentation at Enrollment
All infants enrolled in the study had been diagnosed as suffering from CMPA by a pediatric allergist. The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms alone in twenty-nine (90.6%) infants, and three (9.4%) infants also had a positive skin prick test to cow’s milk. None of the infants had undergone a formal open or double-blinded oral food challenge (OFC) at the time of enrollment. The clinical manifestations of CMPA are summarized in Table 2.
3.2. Previous Formula Use and Complementary Diet
Prior to commencing a hypoallergenic formula, infants had been trialed on several different types of infant formula by their parents: one formula in 12 (37.5%), two in 7 (21.9%), three in 10 (31.3%), and four different formulas in 3 (9.4%) infants. Twenty-two infants (68.8%) had been fed a cow’s milk-based formula, 27 (84.4%) a soy-based formula, 28 (87.5%) a partially hydrolyzed cow’s milk formula, and 23 (71.9%) a hydrolyzed rice-based formula (HRF). At the time of enrollment, 16 (50.0%) infants were being fed an EHF, 3 (9.4%) infants received an HRF, and 13 (40.6%) were being fed an AAF. Fifteen (46.9%) infants received a complementary weaning diet, which was commenced at a mean age of 4.43 ± 0.90 (SD) months.
3.3. Anthropometric Data
Based on measurements from baseline to V4 (n = 28), the mean weight gain was 18.0 ± 6.13 g per day of formula intake (range 7.8–29.2 g/day). Z-scores for body weight from enrollment to V4 progressed close to the WHO child growth standard, with a minor upward trend towards the end of the first year of life (V5). The mean WAZ increased from −0.31 to +0.28 (delta WAZ +0.59), the LAZ from +0.23 to +0.55 (delta LAZ +0.32), and the HCAZ from +0.55 to +0.78 (delta HCAZ +0.23). The BMIAZ followed a similar pattern, with an increase from −0.61 to −0.04 (delta BMIAZ +0.57). The anthropometric measurements for male and female infants are summarized in Figure 2.
3.4. Formula Intake
The mean duration of formula administration for the principal study period from V0 to V4 was 122.2 ± 6.14 days, and 110.7 ± 47.01 days from V4 to the end of the study visit at V5. The mean formula intake from V0 to V1 was 822.2 ± 206.12 mL/day. The daily formula intake progressively decreased with each visit to 801.8 ± 161.48 mL/day at V2, 782.9 ± 159.70 mL/day at V3, 719.5 ± 200.48 mL/day at V4, and 558 ± 197.58 mL/day at V5 (12 months of age).
3.5. Resolution of CMPA Symptoms and Stool Characteristics
Symptoms improved significantly between enrollment (V0) and follow-up after one month’s treatment (V1). Comparing the proportion of infants with frequent or persistent (‘all the time’) symptoms, there was a 79.9% and 88.4% reduction in crying and fussing, respectively (χ2 = 6.745; p = 0.009). Similarly, the proportion of infants with frequent or persistent regurgitation (‘spitting up’) fell by 51.7% (χ2 = 4.274; p = 0.039), while vomiting was reduced by 90.8% (χ2 = 10.38; p = 0.0013). The prevalence of significant feeding difficulties at V1 was reduced by 87.7% (χ2 = 6.677; p = 0.010), and the prevalence of frequent or persistent skin problems fell from 25% to 6.9% (χ2 = 3.576; p = 0.059). Few infants had significant respiratory symptoms, with only two infants (6.3%) reporting frequent problems at enrollment. Persistent respiratory symptoms had resolved in one (3.4%) infant at V1 (χ2 = 0.269; p = 0.60). A summary of the prevalence of common symptoms is provided in Figure 3.
Regarding stool characteristics, there was a trend to more formed and less frequent stools with increasing age. At V1, the mean stool frequency was 1.5 ± 1.26 (range 0–6) bowel motions per day. At V4, the stool frequency was 1.6 ± 0.73 (range 0–4) and 1.4 ± 0.53 (range 0–2) at V5. Stool consistency was assessed by the Bristol stool scale (types 1–7). The median stool consistency decreased from Bristol type 6 stools (mushy consistency; interquartile range, IQR types 4–6) to type 5 stools (soft, semi-formed consistency; IQR 3.25–6) at V4, and type 4 stools (formed consistency; IQR types 3–5) at V5.
3.6. Safety
There were 232 adverse events (AE) in total, of which 192 (82.8%) were classified as mild, 37 (15.9%) as moderate, and 3 (1.3%) as severe. Six (18.8%) subjects experienced 8 serious adverse events (SAE), all of which were assessed as unrelated to the study formula. The majority of AE affected the gastrointestinal system (69 AE in 26 (81.3%) subjects). In addition, 84 adverse events due to infections were reported in 25 (78.1%) subjects. Fifteen (46.9%) subjects had 30 events due to skin disorders, mainly atopic dermatitis. Nine (28.1%) subjects experienced 12 events of respiratory disorders, and seven (21.9%) subjects had 13 allergic reactions to food (including one episode of anaphylaxis). Eight (25%) subjects reported 14 events due to general disorders or administration site conditions. The remaining 10 AE were coded as accidental injury (n = 2), accidental ingestion (n = 1), dacryostenosis (n = 1), poor feeding/poor weight gain (n = 2), perforated ear drum (n = 1), iron deficiency (n = 1), irritability (n = 1), and inadequate diet (n = 1).
Four AE in two (6.4%) subjects were deemed ‘related’ (n = 3) or ‘probably related’ (n = 1) and led to the discontinuation of the study formula in both cases. One of the subjects had presented with mild gastroesophageal reflux, and the other had developed loose stools, flatulence, and decreased feeding (all graded as mild).
3.7. Microbiological Analysis of Stool Samples
In total, 109 stool samples from 32 infants were available for DNA extraction and genomic sequencing from V0, V1, V4, and V5. All samples were of sufficient quality for genomic analysis. On average, 21.8 M read pairs per sample could be mapped to the reference gene catalog, representing on average 95.2% of the high-quality non-host reads (range 79.4–98.1%). Duplicate samples and samples of subjects only providing baseline samples were excluded, leaving 105 samples from 29 infants for the final analysis.
3.7.1. Alpha and Beta Diversity
Faith’s PD was calculated to assess the alpha diversity at each study visit. Overall, phylogenetic diversity increased with age. Faith’s PD increased significantly at V4 and V5, compared to the baseline (V0). Similarly, the PD increased significantly for each age group; Figure 4A,B.
Changes in beta diversity, i.e., the overall microbiome community composition, were evaluated using weighted UniFrac distances, which reflect differences in relative abundance, as well as phylogenetic distances among MGS. There were highly significant group differences in beta diversity, both when comparing by study visits (R2 = 5.37%; p = 0.003) or age windows (R2 = 4.93%; p < 0.0001); Figure 5.
3.7.2. Taxonomic Characterization and Temporal Development
The taxonomic analysis was performed using the metagenomic species (MGS) concept. Figure 6 illustrates the taxonomic profiles aggregated at the phylum, family, genus, and species levels.
At the phylum level, there was a substantial enrichment in Actinobacteria (which includes bifidobacteria) from V0 to V1 (p = 0.01; FDR = 0.031), V4 (p = 0.001; FDR = 0.016), and V5 (p = 0.05; FDR = 0.071). Conversely, Proteobacteria were significantly reduced at V1 (p = 0.0006; FDR = 0.003), V4 (p < 0.00001; FDR < 0.00001), and V5 (p < 0.00001; FDR = 0.0004) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, at the family level, Enterobacteriaceae were highly abundant at V0 and significantly decreased at V1 (p = 0.0008; FDR = 0.022), V4 (p < 0.000001; FDR < 0.0001), and V5 (p < 0.0001; FDR < 0.0007) (Figure 6B).
At the genus level, the abundance of bifidobacteria increased with borderline significance from V0 to V1 (p = 0.016; FDR = 0.157) and V4 (p = 0.046; FDR = 0.137) (Figure 6C). The genus Escherichia spp. showed a highly significant reduction from V0 to V1 (p = 0.0002; FDR = 0.010), V4 (p < 0.00001; FDR < 0.00034), and V5 (p = 0.006; FDR = 0.030). The genus Akkermansia spp. Was enriched at V4 (p < 0.0031; FDR < 0.021) and borderline significant at V5 (p = 0.057; FDR = 0.121). The abundances of several genera were significantly increased at V5, compared to V0, including Faecalibacterium spp. (p = 0.0002; FDR = 0.0063), Roseburia spp. (p = 0.026; FDR = 0.068), Bacteroides spp. (p = 0.010; FDR = 0.034), and Prevotella spp. (p = 0.012; FDR = 0.036). Finally, the abundances of several genera were significantly decreased at V5 compared to V0, including Rothia spp. (p < 0.0001; FDR = 0.0002), Klebsiella spp. (p = 0.0009; FDR = 0.133), Enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0049; FDR = 0.025), Streptococcus spp. (p = 0.0071; FDR = 0.0303), and Citrobacter spp. (p = 0.009; FDR = 0.031).
Due to the relatively small sample size and significant age gradient at V0, there were few significant findings at the species level, and the comparisons of individual bifidobacterial species mostly did not reach statistical significance. Escherichia coli was significantly reduced at V1, V4, and V5 (p < 0.01; FDR < 0.05). In line with findings at the genus level, Akkermansia muciniphila was more abundant at V4 (p = 0.0046; FDR = 0.036) and borderline significant at V5 (p = 0.057; FDR = 0.130). Finally, butyrate-producing gut bacteria were significantly enriched, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, at V4 (p = 0.002; FDR = 0.025) and V5 (p = 0.0001; FDR = 0.0035), and Anaerostipes caccae (p = 0.001; FDR = 0.035) at V4 (Figure 6D).
3.7.3. Effect on Bifidobacterial Composition and Abundances
Of the 11 selected MGS annotated to the genus Bifidobacterium, 10 were detected in at least one fecal sample. At V1, B. breve, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum, and B. bifidum were the most abundant bifidobacterial species (Figure 6D). When testing for differences in the relative abundance, B. pseudocatenulatum: MGS.hg0101 and B. catenulatum subsp. kashiwanohense: MGS.hg0185 were significantly increased at V1 (p = 0.047), V4 (p = 0.008) and V5 (p = 0.001), compared to V0. Furthermore, the abundance of B. breve: MGS.hg0209 increased from V0 to V1 with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.08).
A sub-analysis assessed the relative abundances of the HMO-utilizing Bifidobacterium set. There was an increase of borderline significance in this set from V0 to V1 (p = 0.07), with a significant enrichment demonstrated for subsequent visits at V4 (p = 0.017) and V5 (p = 0.005) (Figure 7).
3.7.4. Taxon Set Enrichment Analysis
The taxon set enrichment analysis (TSEA) was used to assess the enrichment or suppression of taxonomic groups based on changes in relative MGS abundances between visits. Table 3 shows the main significant findings of the TSEA at the genus level for V1, V4, and V5, compared to the baseline (V0).
At V1, four bifidobacterial species were significantly enriched (RBC = 0.704; p = 0.017; FDR = 0.083) (Table 3). These consisted of the infant-type bifidobacteria, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. longum subsp. longum and B. longum subsp. infantis (Figure 8). By contrast, the proteobacterium Escherichia spp. was significantly suppressed (RBC = –0.911; p = 0.007; FDR = 0.082). At V4, nine MGS from the genus Lachnoclostridium spp. were enriched (RBC = 0.707; p = 0.0005; FDR = 0.0006), while the Proteobacteria Klebsiella spp. (RBC = –0.671; p = 0.024; FDR = 0.065) and Escherichia spp. were suppressed (RBC = –0.994; p = 0.004; FDR = 0.020). At V5, six MGS of Bacteroides spp. were enriched (RBC = 0.911; p = 0.007; FDR = 0.082) at the expense of Streptococcus spp., Escherichia spp., and Rothia spp.; Table 3.
3.8. Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Levels
Fecal concentrations of the three SCFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, increased significantly from enrollment to 12 months of age (Figure 9). Relatively high levels of fecal acetate, a key metabolite of HMO-utilizing bifidobacteria, were found throughout the entire study to 12 months of age. Fecal butyrate levels increased progressively from V0 to V5, while propionate levels peaked at V4 and declined slightly towards V5.
