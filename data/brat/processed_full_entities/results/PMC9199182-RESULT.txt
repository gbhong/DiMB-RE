aData are presented as mean (SD) for continuous measures, and n (%) for categorical measures. Plant-based dietary index, dietary intakes and total energy presented were calculated based on the FFQs, and 3-day 24-h dietary recalls for long-term diet and short-term diet, respectively. Dietary intake for each food group was adjusted for total energy intake using the residual method
bUrbanization index, a 12-component scale based on community-level physical, social, cultural, and economic environments, was categorized as low (≤ 63), middle (63–84.3), and high (> 84.3) levels of urbanization
cCurrent tea and coffee drinking status were estimated based on the FFQ information
In 2015, the mean (± SD) PDI were 45 ± 5 and 46 ± 6 for long-term diet and short-term diet, respectively. Participants with a higher long-term or short-term PDI score were less likely to be smokers or alcohol drinkers (Table 1). The food components of the plant diet index were correlated with each other at weak to moderate magnitudes (Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from − 0.33 to 0.50).
The mean levels (± SD) of fasting blood glucose, Hb1Ac, insulin, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, TG, and CRP were 5.54 ± 1.55 mmol/L, 5.74 ± 0.98%, 7.85 ± 7.76 μU/mL, 1.27 ± 0.33 mmol/L, 3.20 ± 0.91 mmol/L, 4.98 ± 1.01 mmol/L, 1.58 ± 1.19 mmol/L, 1.86 ± 3.65 mg/L, respectively. Participants who had a higher long-term PDI had lower LDL-C and TC. Similar trend was observed for short-term PDI (Table 1).
Associations of the long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns with overall gut microbiome configuration. A Long-term plant-based dietary pattern and its constituent food groups were correlated with short-term estimates. The red-to-blue gradient in the outer blocks represents the magnitude and direction of the Spearman correlation between long-term dietary factors and short-term dietary factors. The correlations were displayed with color within blocks when significant (p < 0.05). B Associations of long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns with bacterial richness and diversity. Beta coefficients were derived from multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models for Q2–Q5 of PDIs using Q1 as the reference group. Covariates included age, sex, BMI, total energy intake, physical activity, education, smoking and alcohol drinking status, habitual tea and coffee consumption, urbanization index, sampling location (random effect), sequencing depth, and sequencing batch (random effect). All four alpha-diversity indices were standardized to Z-score values before statistical analysis. C Associations of plant-based foods and animal-based foods with bacterial richness and diversity. Beta coefficients were derived from multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models as above for Q5 of each food group using Q1 as the reference group. All four alpha-diversity indices were standardized to Z-score values before statistical analysis. Non-significant associations (p > 0.05) have been scored 0 and hence colored white. D Proportion of variation in taxonomy at ASV level explained by the long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns and as quantified by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity). The p values were calculated by adjusting for the same covariates as above. Faith’s PD, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity; hPDI, healthful plant-based diet index; PDI, plant-based diet index; Pielou’s evenness, Pielou’s measure of species evenness; Q, quintile; Shannon, Shannon’s diversity index; uPDI, unhealthful plant-based diet index. *** p < 0.001
Long-term PDIs and all 15 constituent food groups were significantly correlated with corresponding short-term estimates (p < 0.05, Fig. 2A). The correlation coefficients were 0.26, 0.28, and 0.22 for PDI, hPDI, and uPDI, respectively (Fig. 2A). Among 15 food groups, animal oils (r = 0.50), meat (r = 0.37), eggs (r = 0.36), and fish or seafood (r = 0.36) showed strongest correlations, whereas beverages and fruit juices (r = 0.08), nuts (r = 0.09), and legumes (r = 0.09) showed the weakest correlations.

Plant-based diet and gut microbiome
Higher short-term hPDI was associated with higher Shannon’s diversity index and Pielou’s measure of species evenness (Fig. 2B). However, no statistically significant association was seen between the long-term PDIs and microbial alpha-diversity (Fig. 2B). Of the 15 food groups, we observed a positive association of short-term intake of vegetable oils with Pielou’s measure of species evenness and Shannon’s diversity index (Fig. 2C, Additional file 1 Table S3). In accordance with a previous study, a higher long-term intake of whole grains was associated with all four alpha-diversity indices (Fig. 2C, Additional file 1 Table S4). Interestingly, short-term dairy consumption was inversely associated with Pielou’s measure of species evenness and Shannon’s diversity index, whereas long-term dairy intake had a positive association with observed features and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (Fig. 2C, Additional file 1 Table S3-S4). Similar results were obtained regardless of further adjustment for prevalent hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or related medicine use for the above diet-microbial diversity associations (Additional file 1 Table S5-S6).
We proceeded to identify the links between a plant-based diet and the overall microbial structure (beta-diversity). In multivariable analyses, the association between long-term PDIs and microbial beta-diversity (at ASV level) was stronger than short-term PDIs (Fig. 2D). The strongest association was found between long-term PDI and microbial beta-diversity, explaining 0.6% of the dissimilarities in the gut microbiota structure (p < 0.001).
Distinct gut microbial signatures between long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns. A Association of long-term and short-term PDI with Firmicutes. Beta values were calculated for Q2-Q5 of the PDI using Q1 as the reference group using linear mixed models. All models used sampling location as a random effect and simultaneously adjusted for age, sex, BMI, total energy intake, physical activity, education, smoking and alcohol drinking status, habitual tea and coffee consumption, and urbanization index. The p-value for trend was calculated based on per quintile difference in the corresponding plant-based diet index. The relative abundance of microbial taxonomy was transformed using rank-based inverse normal transformation before analysis. B The number of nominally significant taxonomic associations observed in genus and ASV level with long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns (Q5 vs. Q1 p<0.05). The bars with stripes represent those significant after FDR adjustment (q<0.25). C Associations of long-term and short-term plant-based dietary patterns and its constituent food groups with microbial genera with the asterisks denoting significant associations (FDR q < 0.25). Beta coefficients were derived from multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models as above for Q5 of each dietary indicator using Q1 as the reference group. The relative abundance of microbial taxonomy was transformed using rank-based inverse normal transformation before analysis. Microbial genera with no significant associations are not shown. The number of each microbe’s associations with dietary indicators is written within cells when significant. FDR, false discovery rate; hPDI, healthful plant-based diet index; PDI, plant-based diet index; Q, quintile; uPDI, unhealthful plant-based diet index. *FDR q < 0.25, ** FDR q < 0.05
We then focused on identifying the specific taxa responsible for these diet-microbiota community associations. Higher long-term PDI was associated with lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (Q5 vs. Q1 beta =  − 0.15; 95% CI, − 0.26 to -0.03; p < 0.05). At the same time, we observed no statistically significant differences in Firmicutes across different quintiles of the short-term PDI (Fig. 3A). All three indices based on long-term diet and short-term diet had nominally significant associations with taxonomies at ASV or genus level (Q5 vs. Q1 p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). Among 145 genera with a mean relative abundance of ≥ 0.01% and a prevalence of ≥ 10%, a total of 14 genera were significantly associated with at least one dietary indicator (q < 0.25). Short-term PDI had one FDR-adjusted significant association, and it was four for short-term hPDI, two for short-term uPDI, one for long-term PDI, and three for long-term uPDI (Q5 vs. Q1 q < 0.25, Fig. 3B, Additional file 1 Table S7-S8). We did not find any overlap between the microbial genera associated with long-term PDIs and genera associated with corresponding short-term PDIs (Fig. 3C). We observed an inverse association between short-term PDI and genus Catenisphaera, and similarly for long-term PDI and genus Peptostreptococcus. Short-term hPDI was positively associated with Blautia, Polynucleobacter, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-009, while inversely associated with Dorea. Higher short-term uPDI was associated with a higher relative abundance of ZOR0006, but a lower relative abundance of Polynucleobacter. Long-term uPDI was positively associated with Exiguobacterium and F0332, but inversely associated with [Eubacterium] xylanophilum group. Under the FDR threshold of 0.15, all the four identified taxonomic associations of the long-term PDIs were still significant, and three taxonomic associations of the short-term estimates were significant (including hPDI-Polynucleobacter, uPDI- ZOR0006 and hPDI- Blautia).
In the secondary analyses for specific food groups, we identified five significant diet-microbe associations (Q5 vs. Q1 q < 0.25, Fig. 3C, Additional file 1 Table S9-S10). All those significant associations were related to long-term dietary intake. We observed an inverse association between long-term nut intake and Enterococcaceae spp., between long-term legume intake and Exiguobacterium, between long-term animal oil consumption and [Eubacterium] ruminantium group and Paraeggerthella. We found a positive association between long-term refined grains intake and Terrisporobacter.
In our functional pathway profiling using PICRUST, we did not identify any association of long-term, short-term PDIs or their constituent food groups with microbial functional pathways (Q5 vs. Q1 q > 0.25, Additional file 1 Table S11-S14).

Association of gut microbiota with cardiometabolic risk factors
Association of the gut microbial signatures related to plant-based dietary patterns with cardiometabolic biomarkers. The Sankey chart on the left shows the significant microbial signatures of long-term and short-term plant-based dietary pattern and its constituent food groups. The heatmap in the right shows the association between microbial signatures identified and cardiometabolic biomarkers measured after 3 years. Beta coefficients were derived from the linear regression model, adjusted for baseline age, sex, and corresponding cardiometabolic biomarkers measured in 2015 and expressed as the difference in cardiometabolic biomarkers (in standard deviation unit). Correction for multiple testing (FDR) was applied. CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; FDR, false discovery rate; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; hPDI, healthful plant-based diet index; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PDI, plant-based diet index; Q, quintile; TC, total cholesterol; TG, total triglycerides; uPDI, unhealthful plant-based diet index. * FDR q < 0.25, ** FDR q < 0.05
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that higher microbial alpha-diversity (Pielou’s measure of species evenness) were associated with lower TG after 3-year follow-up (p < 0.05, Additional file 1 Supplementary Table S15). We also found four gut microbial features (at genus level) of long-term plant diet were significantly associated with future fasting cardiometabolic risk biomarkers, including fasting insulin, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, and CRP (q < 0.25, Fig. 4). Higher long-term PDI was associated with the lower relative abundance of Peptostreptococcus, while this microbe was positively correlated with the inflammatory marker (CRP) and inversely associated with HDL-C. Enterococcaceae spp., which had an inverse association with long-term nut consumption, and was positively associated with fasting insulin. Higher relative abundance of F0332 was significantly associated with higher CRP level. However, gut microbial features (at a genus level) related to short-term dietary estimates showed no significant association with future cardiometabolic risk biomarkers.
