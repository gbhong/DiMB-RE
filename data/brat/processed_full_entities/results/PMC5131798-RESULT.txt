A synthetic human gut microbiota with versatile fiber polysaccharide degrading capacity
Diet changes are known to rapidly affect the composition of the microbiota in humans and rodents. However, the full complexity of the gut microbiota is a barrier to deriving detailed conclusions because sequence-based approaches (16S rRNA gene and meta-genomics/-transcriptomics) suffer from substantial functional uncertainty. Thus, to test our hypothesis that specific members within a fiber-deprived gut microbiota cause damage by increasingly foraging for nutrients in the protective mucus layer, we designed a synthetic microbiota (SM) containing 14 species of fully sequenced commensal human gut bacteria (Fig. 1A). The selected species were chosen to represent the five dominant phyla and collectively possess important core metabolic capabilities (Fig. S1A).
To provide an additional layer of functional knowledge about complex carbohydrate metabolism, we pre-evaluated our 14 species for growth in vitro on a panel of 42 plant- and animal-derived mono- and polysaccharides, including purified mucin O-glycans (MOGs) as sole carbon sources. These growth assays allowed us to determine that all major groups of dietary fiber and host mucosal polysaccharides could be used by one or more strains in our community as well as which bacteria target each glycan (Fig. 1A, Figs. S1A,B, Table S1). It is evident that the four mucin-degrading species fall into two categories: mucin specialists (A. muciniphila and B. intestinihominis), which only grow on MOGs as a sole polysaccharide source, and mucin generalists (B. thetaiotaomicron and B. caccae), which each grow on several other polysaccharides. Overall, our choice of species is physiologically and ecologically representative of the more complex native gut microbiota. Because our community is composed of bacteria with determined carbohydrate metabolic abilities, it allows us to address our central hypothesis in more precise, mechanistic detail.
To develop a gnotobiotic model, we assembled the SM in germfree mice, which were fed a standard fiber-rich (FR) laboratory diet that contains ~15% dietary fiber from minimally processed grains and plants (Figs. 1B,C). Colonized animals were maintained on the FR diet for 14 days to monitor reproducibility and stability of community assembly (Fig. 1B). All of the introduced species persisted in each mouse between 6 and 54 or 66 days of colonization depending on the length of the experiment (n = 37 total, 2 independent experiments; analyzed by both 16S rRNA sequencing (Table S2) and quantitative PCR approaches (Table S3)). Individual mice exhibited reproducible SM assembly irrespective of caging, mouse gender, experimental replicate or method of analysis (Fig. S2, Tables S2, S3). In addition to 29 germfree control animals, a total of 4 different gnotobiotic colonization experiments (51 SM-colonized mice in total; Experiments 1–4) were performed according to the timeline shown in Fig. 1B.
Both chronic and intermittent fiber deficiency promotes enrichment of mucus-degrading bacteria
Although dietary changes are known to perturb microbiota composition, the impact of diet variation, especially chronic or intermittent fiber deficiency, on the activities and abundance of mucin-degrading bacterial communities has not been studied in functional detail. After validating stable SM colonization, three groups of mice were maintained by constant feeding of one of three different diets: Fiber-rich (FR), Fiber-free (FF) or Prebiotic (Pre). In contrast to the FR diet that contained naturally milled food ingredients with intact fiber particles, the Pre diet was designed to study the effect of adding a mixture of purified, soluble glycans, similar to those used in prebiotic formulations (Fig. 2C). To imitate the fact that the human diet experiences fluctuating amounts of fiber from meal-to-meal, four other groups were alternated between the FR and FF or Pre and FF diets on a daily- or four-day basis (Fig. 1B).
Fecal microbial community dynamics showed that in mice switched to the FF diet, several species rapidly and reproducibly changed in abundance (Figs. 2A,B; Fig. S3). Four species—A. muciniphila, B. caccae, B. ovatus and E. rectale—were highly responsive to diet change. A. muciniphila and B. caccae are able to degrade MOGs in vitro. B. ovatus and E. rectale cannot metabolize MOGs, but together can use a broad range of polysaccharides found in dietary fiber (Fig. 1A). In the absence of fiber, the abundance of A. muciniphila and B. caccae increased rapidly with a corresponding decrease of the fiber-degrading species (Fig. 2A). The Pre diet, which contains purified polysaccharides and is otherwise isocaloric with the FF diet, had a similar effect on community composition as the FF diet but separated slightly by PCoA ordination from FF, likely due to increased Bacteroides abundance (Figs. 2A,B). Intriguingly, the abundances of the same four bacteria noted above fluctuated rapidly on a daily basis when the FR and FF diets were oscillated (Fig. 2C; Figs. S3), corroborating their ability to respond dynamically to variations in dietary fiber. The increase in mucin-degrading species observed in fecal samples matched with cecal abundances at the end of the experiment (Fig. 2D and panels to the right of plots in Fig. 2A). Moreover, similar levels of mucin-degrading bacteria were quantified in the colonic lumen and mucus layer using laser capture microdissection (Fig. 2E), indicating that proliferation of mucin-degrading bacteria in this model is a community-wide effect and not limited just to the mucus layer.
Many of the other bacteria (except R. intestinalis and B. intestinihominis) were sensitive to changes between the FR and FF diets on daily and four-day bases, albeit to lower degrees (Fig. S3B, Table S2). Two additional species especially sensitive to diet change were Desulfovibrio piger (increased on FF diet) and Marvinbryantia formatexigens (decreased on FF diet) (Fig. S3A). Population changes in the groups oscillated between Pre and FF diets were similar to the abundances observed in FF only diet regimen (Table S2). Thus, despite the pure polysaccharides contained in the Pre diet exerting a clear physiological impact on the microbiota (discussed below), the amount and composition of the purified polysaccharides in this diet exert little effect on species composition.
Community transcriptional and enzymatic readouts demonstrate enhanced degradation of mucus when fiber is absent
Since mucin-degrading bacteria were higher on both the FF and Pre diets that lack naturally complex plant fiber, we reasoned that this increased abundance is due to their ability to degrade mucus as an alternative nutrient. To test this, we measured changes in transcripts encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that enable gut bacteria to utilize dietary fiber and mucosal polysaccharides (cecal samples from all but the 4-day oscillation groups were analyzed).
Based on new or existing genome annotations of the 14 species in our synthetic community, a total of 1,661 different degradative CAZymes belonging to 96 different families were detected (glycoside hydrolase, GH; polysaccharide lyase, PL; and carbohydrate esterase, CE, families were counted). This number is close to the total number of families (122) that was identified in a larger survey of 177 human gut bacterial reference genomes, indicating that our synthetic community retains much of the metabolic potential towards carbohydrates that is present in a more diverse microbiota. Of the 96 enzyme families in our community, members of 38 families, plus M60-like proteases (pfam13402), a group of enzymes previously shown to degrade mucin glycoproteins, showed variable expression in either FR/FF or Pre/FF community transcriptome comparisons (Fig. 3A). These differentially abundant degradative enzymes mapped to 770 different genes contributed from all species except D. piger (Table S4).
Our transcriptomic data show that in the mice fed the FR diet, transcripts belonging to enzyme families that target dietary fiber polysaccharides were more abundant. In contrast, in mice fed the FF diet, transcripts encoding enzyme families known to release sugars from host substrates, including mucin O-glycans, were elevated (Fig. 3A). In line with our in vitro growth assays (Fig. 1A) and the microbial community abundance data (Fig. 2), we found that B. ovatus and E. rectale contributed a majority of CAZymes specific for plant polysaccharides (Fig. 3A). The four in vitro mucin degraders were the major contributors to the degradation of host glycans and mucus in vivo. Additionally, transcripts encoding M60-like proteases (pfam13402) were also more highly expressed in FF conditions (Fig. 3A). Expression of these putative mucin-targeting enzymes was primarily contributed by B. caccae, an organism that possesses 16 of these genes compared to just 4 in A. muciniphila and 5 in all other species combined. This observation suggests the tantalizing possibility that B. caccae is particularly equipped via its M60-like proteases to perform a key degradative step (cleavage of glycoprotein backbones) during mucin foraging and this ability may facilitate access to mucus carbohydrate structures by other bacteria.
In the group fed the Pre diet, similar transcripts as in the FR-fed group were elevated relative to FF, albeit to lower levels (Fig. 3A bottom histogram). Furthermore, transcripts for the same bacterial enzymes presumed to target mucus in the FR/FF diet comparison were observed in the Pre/FF comparison. Additional RNA-Seq analyses of cecal transcriptomes from mice oscillated between FR/FF and Pre/FF on a daily basis (collected after 1 day on FF diet) provided similar results to those obtained for the FF only diet mice (Table S4). Our transcriptomic readouts corroborate the increased abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria observed in these mice (Fig. 2D) and demonstrate that even intermittent fiber deficiency has the potential to alter the microbiota and favor mucin-degrading species.
To further connect the in vivo responses of B. caccae and A. muciniphila with degradation of mucin O-glycans, we performed additional transcriptional profiling of these two species on purified MOGs from porcine gastric mucus. We have previously shown that this mixture contains ~130 different structures that when metabolized by B. thetaiotaomicron stimulate a transcriptional response that overlaps substantially with genes expressed in vivo under fiber-restricted conditions. During growth on MOGs as the sole carbon source, B. caccae and A. muciniphila activated expression of 82 and 61 genes, respectively (Table S5). In previous microarray data from growth in the same substrate, B. thetaiotaomicron activated expression of 166 genes. Next, we examined expression of these validated O-glycan-responsive genes (for B. caccae, A. muciniphila and B. thetaiotaomicron) in the SM community from FF-fed mice compared to FR. In support of our hypothesis, validated B. caccae and A. muciniphila O-glycan-responsive genes were increased in the FF condition (Fig. 3B). B. caccae expression was increased irrespective of normalization by reads mapped to the whole community (i.e., including increased B. caccae abundance) or to just the B. caccae genome (discounts abundance change and examines changes in expression).
Consistent with its specialization for O-glycans, A. muciniphila mostly showed increased expression of O-glycan-responsive genes proportional to its increased population size (from ~20% to ~40%), indicating that it does not shift its substrate utilization in comparison to the FR diet (Fig. 3B, see also Table S6e). The idea that B. caccae is capable of broader transcriptional shifts, compared to A. muciniphila, is further supported by global analysis of its gene expression changes between the FF and FR diets and one-day alternations (Fig. S4). In response to the FF diet, B. caccae showed increased in vivo expression of 237 genes, including 29 degradative enzymes; whereas, A. muciniphila only showed increased expression of 43 genes, including 2 enzymes (Fig. S4). In contrast to previous monoassociation data, B. thetaiotaomicron mostly showed unchanged or slightly decreased expression of its known O-glycan utilization genes after a shift to FF (Fig. 3B, Table S6b).
Colonic mucin O-glycans contain glycosidic linkages distinct from plant fibers and also covalently linked sulfate. In further support of increased bacterial degradation of the host mucus on the FF diet, we detected significantly increased bacterial enzymes (sulfatase and α-fucosidase) in the mice subjected to the FF diet on either a chronic or intermittent basis (Fig. 3C). In contrast, enzymes targeting linkages in fiber polysaccharides (β-glucosidase) were significantly reduced in the mice fed the fiber-deficient diets, while others involved in xylan and α-galactan degradation trended similarly without significance (Fig. 3C).Despite the dramatic change in microbiota species abundance and transcriptional response, there was only one significant change (succinate) in SCFA and organic acids in the FF diet fed mice (Fig. 3D). Overall, the transcriptomic and enzyme analyses support the conclusion that a fiber-deprived gut microbiota synergistically and progressively expresses CAZymes, sulfatases and proteases to attack mucus polysaccharides when the diet lacks complex plant fiber.
Fiber deprivation leads the gut microbiota to degrade the colonic mucus barrier
The mucus layer is a dynamic barrier that is constantly replenished through the secretory activity of goblet cells. We rationalized that if bacterial consumption of mucin-derived nutrients exceeds new production, the integrity of this critical barrier could be compromised. To explore this possibility, we performed blinded thickness measurements of the colonic mucus layer from proximal colon to rectum in each mouse using Alcian blue stained sections (Fig. 4A). We further validated thickness of the mucus layer by immunofluorescence staining of the Muc2 mucins using α-Muc2 antibody (Fig. 4B). To address the possibility that variations in thickness are directly influenced by the diets used, we measured mucus layer thickness in germfree mice fed the FR or FF diets.
Colonic mucus measurements revealed that mucus thickness was highest in the colonized group fed the FR diet (Fig. 4C). In most other groups, including germfree (GF) controls, mucus thickness was significantly thinner than colonized FR mice. The observation that GF mice have thinner colonic mucus is consistent with previous studies in gnotobiotic mice and rats, which found that microbial colonization or exposure to cues such as peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharides is required for mucus production. Notably, mucus in SM-colonized FF diet mice was 5–6X thinner than colonized mice fed the FR diet. From these data, we conclude that the mucus layer: i) is initially thinner in GF mice regardless of diet, ii) begins expanding upon microbial colonization, but iii) is disproportionately eroded back to a thinner layer due to the increased mucus foraging activity by the microbiota in the context of the FF diet. A similar reduction in mucus thickness was observed in the Pre diet and both 4-day oscillation groups, while an intermediate thickness was observed in the 1-day FR/FF oscillation group (Fig. 4C).
Next, we determined whether mucus production was altered in colonized mice fed the FF diet. We examined the abundance of transcripts encoding several key proteins involved in building and regulating the mucus barrier (Fig. 4D): Muc2 and Muc5ac, two building blocks of colonic mucus; Tff1 and Tff3, goblet cell proteins that promote mucosal repair and protection; and Klf3 a transcription factor involved in barrier function. Our results show that the transcription of the major colonic mucin gene (Muc2) was slightly elevated in the colonized FF diet group, suggesting a compensatory response of the host to offset the increased bacterial mucus degradation in this group; whereas other genes (Muc5ac, Tff1, Tff3 and Klf3) remained statistically unchanged (Fig. 4D). Qualitative visualization by Alcian blue (Fig. 4A) staining supports the conclusion that the colonic tissue of FF-fed colonized mice contained similar numbers of goblet cells that have yet to secrete their glycoproteins.
As expected, degradation of the mucus layer by the fiber-deprived gut microbiota brought luminal bacteria closer to the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 4B, inset), which could potentially trigger deleterious effects or other host compensatory responses. Histopathology (Fig. S5A) and body weight measurements over time (Fig. S5B) of mice from the groups with reduced mucus thickness did not reveal changes compared to the mice consuming the FR diet. However, measurements of three additional host parameters provided support for altered host responses in the face of mucus erosion: The first was fecal lipocalin – a neutrophil protein that binds bacterial siderophores and is associated with low-grade inflammation – which was increased in the group of colonized mice fed the FF diet compared to those fed FR (Fig. 4E). A second readout, colon length, revealed shorter colons in colonized FF fed mice and other SM colonized groups when compared to colonized FR fed mice or GF mice on either diet (Fig. 4F). Additional analysis of host cecal tissue global transcriptional responses failed to reveal large-scale changes in the host; although, some compensatory responses were suggested by pathway analysis, which illuminated several immune responses as altered in the colonized FF fed mice (Fig. 4G, Fig. S5C, Table S7). Collectively, the data described above indicate that fiber-restricted, colonized mice experience erosion of the mucus barrier and some altered intestinal responses, albeit without overt signs of disease.
A fiber-deprived gut microbiota promotes heightened pathogen susceptibility
Since the mucus layer is a critical barrier against both commensal microbes and invading pathogens, we next hypothesized that the reduction in thickness associated with microbiota activity during low-fiber conditions would increase pathogen susceptibility. To test this idea, we chose the attaching/effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (Cr) because it must traverse the mucus layer to access the epithelium and cause colitis. Towards this point, a previous study demonstrated that mice genetically lacking the dominant colonic mucin glycoprotein (Muc2−/−), but not wild-type mice, develop lethal colitis following infection with Cr, highlighting that the mucus layer is an important initial barrier to this pathogen.
Therefore, we recreated the previously observed diet-modulated thick and thin mucus layer phenotypes in gnotobiotic mice, and infected both groups with Cr (Fig. S6A). To control for diet-specific effects on Cr pathogenesis in the absence of our SM, we infected two additional groups consisting of germfree (GF) mice fed a priori (~4 weeks before infection) the same FR or FF diets. We collected fecal samples each day post Cr infection to measure changes in pathogen colonization by both selective plating for Cr and 16S rRNA gene analysis (Figs. 5A,B, Fig. S6A). In the two groups colonized by the synthetic microbiota, Cr levels gradually increased but were significantly higher beginning at day 2 in mice fed the FF diet, and remained ~10-fold higher thereafter.
The dramatic diet-specific increase of Cr levels in SM-colonized mice fed the FF diet was accompanied by weight loss that was specific to this group (Fig. 5C). Importantly, both GF+Cr groups that had high pathogen levels (Fig. 5A) failed to exhibit similar weight loss, illuminating that the pathogen alone is insufficient for this effect on either diet. The higher pathogen burdens in colonized mice fed the FF diet were associated with multiple signs of morbidity such as hunched posture and inactivity. Notably, by 10 days post infection, 60% of the mice from the SM colonized FF group had to be euthanized due to ≥20% loss of body weight (Fig. 5D). Mice in the other 3 groups did not show similar morbidity.
Histological scoring of the cecal and colonic tissue revealed that the SM-colonized FF diet group experienced inflammation that covered a significantly more expansive surface area (Figs. 5E–G). An exception was the descending colon/rectum, which showed larger areas of inflamed tissue in both FR and FF groups; although, the FF group was still significantly higher and 100% affected. When the tissue was inflamed, the level of hyperplasia was similar across all four groups (Fig. S6B). Importantly, there were overall lower levels of inflamed tissue in both of our GF+Cr control groups. To determine if increased mucus production post infection could explain the lower disease observed in the GF+Cr groups, we measured thickness of the colonic mucus and found that Cr triggered only a slight increase in GF mucus thickness; whereas the thick mucus layer associated with the FR diet in the context of microbiota colonization persisted (Fig. S7A,B).
Based on the above results, we further hypothesized that the increased area of inflamed tissue in FF mice was due to earlier and increased pathogen access due to the microbiota-degraded mucus layer. To test this idea, we infected the same four treatment groups (SM-colonized or GF mice, fed either FR or FF diets) with a luciferase-expressing Cr strain (Fig. 6A). At 4 days post infection, we sacrificed all mice and conducted bioluminescent imaging of the colons after flushing out the luminal contents. In support of our hypothesis, and despite having similar levels of fecal Cr in FR- and FF-fed SM mice (Fig. 6B), we saw significantly higher pathogen signal adherent to the colonic tissue of SM colonized mice fed the FF diet as compared to those fed FR (Figs. 6C,D). The higher levels of attached Cr in FF fed SM mice were further validated by transmission electron microscopy, revealing increased appearance of the attaching and effacing lesions, pedestals and loss of microvilli that is typically associated with Cr infection (Fig. 6E). Notably, GF+Cr mice on either diet displayed similarly high adherent bacterial signal as the FF-fed SM mice (Fig. 6D, Fig. S7C). Taken together, these results suggest that the pathogen can more quickly traverse the thin colonic mucus layers in GF mice (irrespective of diet) and SM-colonized mice fed the FF diet. However, the commensal microbiota is also required in the context of increased pathogen access to elicit more severe disease, possibly by provoking co-inflammatory responses.
