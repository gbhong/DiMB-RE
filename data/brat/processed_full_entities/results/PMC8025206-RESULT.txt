Demographic characteristics of participants are presented in Table 2. There were no differences observed between the bacterial relative abundances at the start of each period, indicating adequacy of washout length. No differences were observed by sex. There were no differences in bacterial abundance change from baseline between GSTM1 present and absent participants during the control period. During the broccoli diet period, there were no significant differences in bacterial abundance change from baseline, but subjects with GSTM1 absent tended to have a greater increase in Bacteroidetes (P=0.09) and a greater increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio (P=0.08), whereas those with GSTM1 present tended to have an increase in B. thetaiotaomicron (P=0.06) (Supplemental Figures 1–2).
There were no differences in alpha diversity between the two treatment periods (Figure 1). Among beta diversity measurements, weighted Unifrac distances revealed differences between the two treatments (Figure 2). Specifically, distances between samples were smaller following broccoli consumption than following the control period (Bonferroni adjusted P=0.03), indicating that the individuals’ microbial community structures were more similar to each other following the broccoli consumption period.
The five most abundant phyla and five most abundant genera within the Bacteroidetes phylum are presented in Figure 3. At the end of the broccoli consumption period, the Bacteroidetes phylum had increased (P =0.03) by 10%, whereas the Firmicutes decreased (P=0.05) by 8% (Figure 4A–B). The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes thus increased (P=0.01) by 37% from baseline, compared to a decrease of 5% during the control period (Figure 4C). The Bacteroides genus increased (P=0.02) by 6% following broccoli consumption, compared to a 2% decrease during the control period (Figure 5). Bacteroides virfgatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were not significantly different between the two groups but showed high inter-individual variation (Figures 6–7).
We previously reported no main effect of treatment on plasma or urine metabolites in this study, but an interesting dichotomy was revealed whereby participants with BMI < 26 kg/m2 (median) had an increase in metabolites after broccoli treatment, but participants with BMI > 26 kg/m2 had the opposite effect. To determine if the microbiota also showed this pattern, our data were bifurcated by BMI. In the low BMI group, the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes increased (P=0.04) by 32% from baseline, compared to a decrease of 26% during the control period (Supplemental Figure 3). The relationships with Bacteroidetes (P=0.09) and Bacteroides (P=0.06) tended to be numerically similar to the full sample (Supplemental Figures 3–4). In the high BMI group, none of the relationships were significant, indicating that our overall findings are driven by the lower BMI group (Supplemental Figures 5–6).
To further analyze associations in the low BMI group, bivariate correlations were performed between metabolites and bacterial relative abundances. The change from baseline in Bacteroidetes during the broccoli intervention was positively correlated with the maximum peak in plasma metabolites (r=0.69, P=0.04), Table 3. The change from baseline in Firmicutes tended to be negatively correlated with the maximum peak in plasma metabolites (r=−0.66, P=0.05) and the change in Bacteridetes to Firmicutes ratio tended to be positively correlated (r=0.58, P=0.1). During the control period, there were no significant associations, but the change in Bacteroidetes to Firmiutes ratio tended to be negatively correlated with urine metabolites (r=−0.59, P=0.09).
We also analyzed the functional potential of the gut microbiome by the end of the feeding trial using PICRUSt (Figure 8). Overall, broccoli consumption increased the pathways involved in the functions of the endocrine system (P=0.05), transport and catabolism (P=0.04), and energy metabolism (P=0.01) and decreased the pathways involved in membrane transport (P=0.03). Further, the predicted protein families enriched in the broccoli group include those involved in cellular transportation and transcription regulation (e.g., RNA polymerase sigma-70 factor).
