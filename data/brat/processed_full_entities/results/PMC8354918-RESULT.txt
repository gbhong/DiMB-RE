Subject characteristics
One hundred and fifty subjects were randomized in the entire FOOD4GUT cohort. Twenty-four patients from the St Luc hospital subcohort provided fresh fecal samples immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C (placebo n = 12, prebiotic n = 12). At baseline, the groups were similar in terms of clinical outcomes (Table S1). Anthropometric and cardiometabolic risk parameters were not significantly affected by the intervention in this subcohort.
Nutrient intake
Both prebiotic and placebo interventions reduced energy and protein intake (Fig. S1, Table S2). Although carbohydrate intake was globally not affected by the intervention, we observed a lower sugar intake for the placebo group and a lower starch intake for the prebiotic group (between-variation p < 0.05). The lower fat intake (resulting from lower intake of SFA, n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA and trans-FA) was significant only in the placebo group. Of note, the baseline values of MUFA and PUFA (in particular n-6 PUFA) were not the same between both groups. Cholesterol intake was lower only with ITF treatment. The DF intake assessed by questionnaires (that does not consider the native inulin supplement) was not significantly modified in this subcohort. We calculated the average fructan content of recipes from both cookbooks using the FiberTAG repertoire detailing fructan content in food products: it reached 11.2 ± 1.7 g per portion for the cookbook designed for prebiotic group versus 0.4 ± 0.1 g per portion for the cookbook designed for placebo group. Importantly, fructan intake estimated by using 1-week recall questionnaire was 3 times larger in the prebiotic group than the placebo group (independently of inulin supplement). Altogether, those results confirmed that the patients followed the dietetic advices throughout the intervention.
Markers of gut barrier and gut inflammation
Fecal concentration of zonulin (a) and calprotectin (b) in obese patients receiving prebiotic or placebo for 3 months. Individual values and means are presented (placebo: n = 9; prebiotic: n = 11). Baseline data were analyzed by Mann–Whitney test (p > 0.05). Matched-pairs Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare changes from baseline (within-group variations;*p ≤ 0.05). Between-groups variations were analyzed by Mann–Whitney U tests (p > 0.05)
We analyzed the impact of the intervention on gut barrier by measuring zonulin in feces, known to regulate tight junctions. High zonulin levels are associated with increased gut permeability. We did not observe any change in fecal zonulin (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, calprotectin, a fecal marker for gut inflammation, decreased of 50% (p = 0.019, Wilcoxon test; statistical power = 0.70) after prebiotic intervention (Fig. 1b).
Fecal short chain fatty acids
Fecal SCFA profile (% identified SCFA) in obese patients receiving prebiotic or placebo for 3 months. Values are means (placebo: n = 10; prebiotic: n = 12). Baseline data were analyzed by Mann–Whitney test (p > 0.05). Matched-pairs Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare changes from baseline (within-group variations;*p ≤ 0.05). Between-groups variations were analyzed by Mann–Whitney U tests (p > 0.05)
Both interventions increased the total amount of SCFA in fecal samples (but not significantly, p > 0.05). Acetate being the major SCFA, significantly increased in the placebo group (statistical power = 0.14) (Fig. 2). Fecal propionic, (iso) butyric and (iso)valeric acid remained unchanged after prebiotic or placebo treatments.

ITF intake induced minor changes in fecal BA concentrations (Table 1). Although tauro-conjugated BA represented a small proportion of total identified BA (< 1%), an increase in the ratio of tauro-conjugated versus free BA occurred in both placebo and prebiotic groups (statistical power = 0.85 for the prebiotic group); this increase being linked to a higher proportion of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) in the prebiotic group. Of note, we observed a different proportion of TCDCA between both groups before intervention (at baseline).

The basal proportion of linolenic acid (C18:3) was different between the groups before intervention (Table 2). Its level increased significantly after ITF treatment whereas it slightly decreased in the placebo group leading to a statistically significant between-variation. More importantly, ITF supplementation significantly increased the levels of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11–18:2) (statistical power = 0.60). Of note, we observed a lower proportion of this conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in the prebiotic group at baseline.

The alpha-diversity indices related to bacterial richness (Observed species), evenness (Pielou) or both (Shannon), were not significantly affected by the intervention (Fig. S2a). The beta-diversity characterizing overall gut microbiota composition was modified by prebiotic treatment as shown by the PcoA of the Weighted UniFrac distance considering the fraction of branch length in a phylogenic tree (Fig. S2b). In fact, important changes in gut microbiota composition were observed after the prebiotic intervention (Table 3, Fig. S2c). We observed a significant increase in Actinobacteria phylum at the expense of Firmicutes after ITF intake versus placebo. At the family level, it corresponded mostly to changes in abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae, respectively to their phyla. Relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae also increased after ITF supplementation but to a lesser extent. At the genus level (Table 3), prebiotics largely increased Bifidobacterium (statistical power = 0.98), with the change still being significant after adjusting it for multiple testing (p = 0.0005, q < 0.05). Other weaker changes (at the p values) are detailed in Table 3. Among them, placebo intervention increased the relative abundance of Enterorhabdus, Eubacterium and Dialister and decreased Senegalimassilia. Prebiotic intervention significantly increased Anaerostipes and Catenibacterium whereas it decreased Actinomyces, Erysipelotrichaceae (UCG003) and also 3 unclassified bacteria from family XIII, Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Those genera were not affected by the placebo.

Heatmap of Spearman’s correlations between significant shift in bacteria due to the intervention and the significant shift in fecal concentrations of biomarkers of gut barrier/inflammation (a) and of the relative proportions of LCFA (b). Orange circles indicate significant negative correlations whereas purple circles represent significant positive correlations (p < 0.05)
Changes in fecal calprotectin were negatively correlated with changes in Dialister (Fig. 3a). More interestingly, decreased fecal calprotectin was correlated with decreased Actinomyces and Erysipelotrichaceae (UCG003) (r = 0.68 and r = 0.45, respectively). We observed that Erysipelotrichaceae (UCG003) was the sole bacteria negatively correlated with changes in fecal acetate and positively correlated with changes in THCA, a precursor of cholic acid synthesis (Fig. S3). Importantly, we found that increased rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11–18:2) correlated with decreased genera belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and higher abundance of Catenibacterium and Bifidobacterium (r =  − 0.49, p = 0.04; r = 0.60, p = 0.01; and r = 0.52, p = 0.03 respectively, Fig. 3b).
