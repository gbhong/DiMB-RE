Per protocol analyses
Participants and baseline variables
Participant recruitment and inclusion/exclusion is illustrated in Figure 1. One hundred and fifty-six participants who were randomly assigned provided complete data at baseline and 136 were retained in the study at follow-up. The overall retention rate of the study was 87%. There were no discernable differences in characteristics between participants who dropped out of the study compared with those who remained in the study. Specifically, there were no significant differences in age and baseline adiposity and glycemic variables between participants who dropped out compared with those who remained in the study (all Ps >0.209).
Following exclusion of participants who either did not provide follow-up data for adiposity variables or those who did not meet the compliance threshold of 80%, 105 participants were included in the final per protocol analyses for adiposity variables of interest. Only 64 participants [34 (control), 30 (treatment)] successfully completed both baseline and follow-up OGTT measures for calculating HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, and IGI.
Participant demographic and anthropometric information is summarized in Table 2. Persons with overweight comprised 41% of the sample whereas 59% had obesity. The majority of the participants were of Caucasian descent (80%) and female (61%). Significant differences in adiposity variables were observed based on sex whereby females had higher SAAT (2383.9 ± 598.5 g compared with 1675.5 ± 749.8 g, P <0.001) whereas males had a higher VS Ratio (0.43 ± 0.14 compared with 0.30 ± 0.09, P <0.001). However, there were no differences in VAT between males and females [711.7 ± 303.7 g (females) compared with 678.0 ± 348.3 g (males), P = 0.601]. There were no significant differences between treatment and control group participants of the same sex.
Background diet and physical activity
There were no statistically significant differences in changes in leisure time physical activity score between the treatment and control groups [–3.6 ± 29.9 (control) compared with 11.4 ± 41.6 (treatment), P = 0.59]. However, there was a significant difference between changes in energy consumption between the control and treatment groups [–109.7 ± 549.7 kcal (control) compared with 174.3 ± 568.4 kcal (treatment), P = 0.011]. As the intervention aimed to maintain overall caloric intake throughout the study and between groups, subsequent statistical analyses adjusted for change in energy consumption to account for background changes in energy consumption between groups.
Intervention effects on central adiposity
The baseline values for the adiposity measures are summarized in Table 3 for descriptive purposes. Baseline and follow-up insulin resistance and sensitivity is described in Table 4. The summary of statistical tests contrasting change in adiposity and glycemic outcomes is summarized in Table 5. There was no significant difference between groups in VAT. The control group had a significantly larger reduction in SAAT. There was a significant difference between groups in change in VS Ratio. Examining the results based on sex revealed that, among females, there was a significant difference between groups in changes in VAT, SAAT, and VS Ratio. On the other hand, among males, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in VAT, SAAT, and VS Ratio. Following controlling for FDR, the differences in changes in VS Ratio between groups remained significant. Similarly, the differences in changes in VS Ratio and SAAT among females persisted following controlling for FDR.
Intervention effects on insulin resistance and sensitivity
The baseline values for the glucose- and insulin-based outcomes are summarized in Table 4 and comparison of changes based on sex and group are summarized in Table 5. There was no difference between groups in changes in HOMA-IR (P = 0.100), Matsuda index (P = 0.285), and the IGI (P = 0.67). Similarly, there were no changes among females or males.
Intent-to-treat analyses
Intervention effects on central adiposity
Intent-to-treat analyses for the adiposity variables were conducted among all participants who were randomly assigned and completed baseline testing in the control [N = 79 (52 females; 27 males)] and treatment [N = 77 (49 females; 28 males)] groups. There was no significant difference between groups in VAT (P = 0.44). The control group had a significantly larger reduction in SAAT (P = 0.012). However, there was a difference between groups in VS Ratio (P = 0.045). Examining the results based on sex revealed that, among females, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in VAT (P = 0.227). However, there were significant differences in SAAT (P = 0.002), and VS Ratio (P = 0.010). On the other hand, among males, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in VAT (P = 0.940), SAAT (P = 0.545), and VS Ratio (P = 0.611). Following controlling for FDR, the significant differences in changes in VS Ratio and SAAT among females persisted.
Intervention effects on insulin resistance and sensitivity
There was a significant difference between groups in changes in HOMA-IR (P = 0.036). However, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in Matsuda index (P = 0.286) and the IGI (P = 0.779). There were no changes among females (all Ps ≥0.161) or males (all Ps ≥0.16). Following controlling for FDR, there were no significant differences in changes across glycemic outcomes.
