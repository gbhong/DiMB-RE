To directly test the role of the gut microbiota in mediating the metabolic benefits of RS, we sought to compare the effects of feeding RS to mice with and without a gastrointestinal microbiota. However, C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the mouse strain traditionally used for diet-induced obesity (DIO) research, are resistant to the effects of feeding a Western diet (WD) when maintained germ-free. In contrast, germ-free (GF) C3H/HeN (C3H) mice are generally not protected against DIO. To compare the role of the gut microbiota in the development of DIO in the two strains of mice, GF and conventionalized (CVZ) C3H and B6 mice were all fed the same WD for 8 weeks. GF B6 mice gained significantly less weight compared to their conventionalized counterparts (Fig. 1a). In contrast, GF C3H mice gained weight similarly to CVZ controls (Fig. 1b). Of note, CVZ C3H mice gained more weight and exhibited a higher energy intake than CVZ B6 mice (Fig. 1). These findings are consistent with previous reports and indicate that GF C3H mice are a tractable model in which to study the role of the microbiota in the therapeutic effects of a dietary fiber in the context of obesity.

Resistant starches improved insulin sensitivity in C3H mice in the presence of a microbiota.

Because C3H mice fed a Western diet gained weight independently of the gut microbiota, we next sought to determine whether C3H mice respond to RS supplementation similarly to B6 mice (in which weight gain was gut microbiota-dependent) in the presence of a microbiota. C3H and B6 mice were fed either a control WD or a WD enriched with 10% RS for 8 weeks (Table 1). A portion of the corn starch in the purified diets was replaced with RS—an approach often applied in human nutritional intervention trials. In those interventions, participants are asked to consume either RS-enriched products or RS supplements with native or readily digestible starch or starch-based products serving as the placebo. The two types of RS fed (resistant starch type 2 (RS2) and resistant starch type 2 (RS4)) in this study were selected because they are known to improve host metabolism (including insulin resistance) yet elicit distinct effects on human gut microbiota composition. In C3H mice, supplementation with RS4 improved insulin sensitivity despite having no impact on body weight, body weight gain, subcutaneous adipose tissue weight, and energy intake (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in B6 mice (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). These experiments revealed that, although the influence of the microbiota on weight gain was line-dependent, animals from both lines maintained the ability to respond to dietary modulation by RS in the presence of a microbiota.

Supplementing a WD with RS2 or RS4 restored the microbial α-diversity reduced by feeding a WD to CVZ C3H mice (Fig. 3a). Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot of β-diversity based on binary Jaccard distance revealed that gut communities clustered according to diet (Fig. 3b). Similar results were obtained via two other independent β-diversity metrics (Bray-Curtis distance and unweighted UniFrac distance, Additional file 2: Fig. S2a, b). Together, these findings indicate that RS induced global changes to the structure of the gut microbiota in mice. Accordingly, parametric analyses revealed that 124 species-like OTUs and 46 taxa were significantly affected by dietary treatment (Fig. 3c; Additional file 3: Tables S1, S2). Interestingly, RS corrected the proportions of seven taxa (Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XIII families and Clostridium IV, Anaerovorax, Oscillibacter, Elizabethkingia, and Flavonifractor genera) whose levels were altered upon feeding a WD. Consistent with observations from a previous RS feeding study of healthy humans, RS4 increased the Bacteroidetes phylum and decreased the Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae families. Non-parametric analysis of bacterial taxa using LEfSe confirmed most of these results and also highlighted that Proteobacteria-related taxa were specifically enriched in the WD-fed mice (Additional file 2: Fig. S2c, d). Altogether, these data indicate that supplementing a WD with RS caused substantial shifts in gut microbiota composition and was able to redress some of the aberrancies induced by feeding a WD. 
Feeding resistant starches improved plasma insulin levels and the index of insulin resistance independently of the gut microbiota in C3H mice
To directly test the role of the gut microbiota in mediating the metabolic benefits of RS, both GF and CVZ C3H mice were fed either a control WD or a WD enriched with 10% RS for 8 weeks (Table 1). We choose to perform this experiment with C3H mice because, unlike the B6, GF C3H mice gained weight similarly to their CVZ littermates when fed a WD. Although WD feeding increased body weight, white adipose tissue weight, and plasma leptin levels in both GF and CVZ mice compared to low-fat diet (LFD) fed controls, RS feeding did not significantly impact these parameters (Additional file 4: Fig. S3a–c). No changes were observed in lean mass (as measured by tibialis muscle weights) for mice on any treatment (Additional file 4: Fig. S3d).

N = 7–8, except for c and f where N = 6–8
Both GF and CVZ C3H mice fed a control WD experienced a significant increase in fasting plasma insulin and glucose levels compared to the LFD-fed control animals (Fig 4a, b). Feeding a RS4-supplemented WD significantly decreased plasma insulin levels in CVZ mice (Fig. 4a). Moreover, these improvements were associated with substantial shifts in gut microbiota composition in CVZ mice (described above). Such associations are often considered an indication that the gut microbiota mediates the health effects of a dietary intervention. However, when a WD supplemented with RS4 was fed to GF C3H mice, plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased to levels consistent with those observed in their CVZ counterparts, demonstrating that this RS-mediated metabolic improvement was not dependent on the presence of a gut microbiota (Fig. 4a). Both GF and CVZ mice fed an RS2-supplemented WD also experienced a similar trend toward decreased insulin levels, although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for CVZ and p = 0.09 for GF, Dunnett’s post hoc tests). Hyperglycemia induced by the WD was not improved with RS feeding (Fig. 4b). Finally, feeding RS4 significantly improved the index of insulin resistance independently of the gut microbiota; feeding RS2 showed a similar trend (p = 0.07 for CVZ and p = 0.13 for GF, Dunnett’s post hoc tests) (Fig. 4c). Dietary supplementation with RS2 and RS4 also significantly improved circulating levels of C-peptide, a protein derived from proinsulin and a measure of insulin secretion, independently of microbial status (Fig. 5a).  
Several reports indicate a role for the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) in bringing about the metabolic benefits of RS, especially reductions in body weights and fat mass accumulation. To that end, we measured the colonic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and plasma levels of molecules related to the regulation of these incretins. Colonic expression of proglucagon, the precursor of GLP-1, was increased by RS4 feeding in a microbiota-dependent manner (Fig. 5b); however, no significant correlations (at the q value level) between proglucagon mRNA expression and any microbial taxa were found (data not shown). Proglucagon expression was increased in GF mice compared to CVZ littermates. In accordance with the increase in colonic proglucagon mRNA expression, active GLP-1 levels in plasma were also increased in GF mice (Fig. 5c) as previously described. However, the RS4-induced increase in proglucagon mRNA expression was not accompanied by a change in active GLP-1 plasma levels (Fig. 5c). This apparent discrepancy between proglucagon mRNA expression and plasma GLP-1 levels has been reported in other studies and could be explained by several factors, such as differences in the activity of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 or the prohormone convertase 1/3. Colonic expression and plasma levels of PYY were not affected by the RS diets (Fig. 5d, e). Of note, PYY levels were globally lower in GF mice compared to CVZ counterparts, consistent with previous reports. WD feeding decreased active ghrelin levels in both GF and CVZ animals compared to the LFD controls, but RS feeding had no additional impact (Fig. 5f). Neither plasma nor subcutaneous adipose tissue mRNA levels of adiponectin were affected by the dietary treatments, suggesting that adiponectin does not play a role in the modulation of insulin sensitivity by RS (Fig. 5g, h).
Reduced expression of adipose tissue macrophage markers in RS-fed mice was associated with improvements in the index of insulin resistance

To begin dissecting how RS could modulate host physiological and metabolic characteristics independently of the microbiota, we examined markers of adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) as these innate immune cells and their polarization phenotypes have been implicated in the control of insulin sensitivity. Feeding RS4 significantly reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) mRNA expression of F4/80, a tissue macrophage marker, in both GF and CVZ mice compared to WD-fed controls (Fig. 6a). SAT expression of CD11c, a marker of antigen presenting cells and M1 macrophages, was reduced by RS2 and RS4 feeding in CVZ mice; a similar change (albeit lower and not statistically significant) was also observed in GF mice (Fig. 6b). F4/80 and CD11c mRNA expression levels in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were also decreased by the RS2 and RS4 treatments in both GF and CVZ mice, but these reductions did not consistently reach statistical significance (Fig. 6c, d). CD11c mRNA expression in SAT and VAT was strongly correlated with the index of insulin resistance for both CVZ and GF mice (Pearson r = 0.75 and 0.68 in SAT, Pearson r = 0.71 and 0.74 in VAT, p < 0.0001). 
To confirm our observations that RS feeding is associated with a modulation of ATM, we isolated the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from the SAT of CVZ mice. As expected, feeding a WD significantly increased the abundance of subcutaneous ATM as well as the ratio of M1 (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD11c+) to M2 (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD206+ or F4/80+ CD11b+ CD301+) macrophages (Fig. 6e–h; Additional file 5: Fig. S4a, b). Dietary supplementation with RS2 or RS4 significantly reduced the percentage of ATM in the SVF (Fig. 6e). Of interest, feeding RS2 and RS4 reduced both the M1 and M2 macrophage populations (Fig. 6f–h; Additional file 5: Fig. S4a, b). Plasma and SAT mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2), a chemokine previously shown to affect macrophage infiltration into adipose tissues, were not affected by RS feeding (Additional file 5: Fig S4c, d), suggesting that changes in this particular chemokine are not responsible for the decreased subcutaneous ATM accumulation observed when mice are fed RS. All together, these data demonstrate that RS-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity are associated with a reduced number of both M1 and M2 macrophages.

Changes in adipose tissue physiology and reduced liver and adipose tissue macrophage infiltration in obese mice have been associated with an improvement in gut permeability. To that end, we investigated intestinal permeability by administering 4 kDa FITC-dextran to GF and CVZ mice but found that none of the dietary treatments significantly altered gut permeability during the fasting state (Fig. 7a). In accordance with this observation, ileal expression of ZO-1 and occludin were also not affected by any of the experimental diets (Fig. 7b, c). Altogether, these findings suggest that RS decrease expression of adipose tissue macrophage markers independently of the gut microbiota and changes in gut permeability. 
Resistant starches redressed Western diet-induced changes in cecal bile acid profiles in both germ-free and conventionalized mice
Several studies report changes in the bile acid (BA) pool composition of individuals diagnosed as prediabetic or with type 2 diabetes. BAs are capable of regulating both insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis as well as reducing the inflammatory activity of macrophages via nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and membrane-bound TGR5 signaling. Moreover, RS feeding has been shown to alter BA levels in both humans and rodents. These reports prompted us to analyze the cecal BA pool of GF and CVZ mice fed RS.
Resistant starches restored the cecal bile acid profiles of germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (CVZ) C3H mice fed experimental diets for 8 weeks. Mean bile acid concentration for each dietary treatment (nmol/g of cecal content). Only bile acids with mean concentrations above 1 nmol/g for at least one experimental treatment are shown.

Complete abbreviation list is available in the supplemental materials and methods. °p < 0.05 versus WD fed mice of the same microbial status (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc tests after normalization by log-transformation when needed). N = 7–8
The cecal BA pool was markedly different between GF and CVZ mice, consistent with previous findings. Specifically, profiles from GF mice were dominated by taurine-conjugated primary bile acids (including tauro-β-muricholic acid) whereas the patterns from CVZ mice were more complex and included elevated levels of secondary BAs (Fig. 8, Additional file 3: Table S3, and Additional file 5: Figure S4e, f). WD feeding significantly increased the concentration of several BAs, such as taurocholic acid (TCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), in both GF and CVZ mice while supplementing the WD with RS redressed these alterations in a microbiota-independent manner (Fig. 8). Interestingly, we observed strong correlations between TCA and TCDCA concentrations and plasma insulin levels, the index of insulin resistance, and ATM markers (q values below 0.0005 for insulin and index of insulin resistance, Additional file 3: Table S3). Together, these findings indicate that RS feeding impacts the cecal BA pool—especially taurine-conjugated BA—in a microbiota-independent manner.
