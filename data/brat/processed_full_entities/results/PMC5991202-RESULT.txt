All 18 participants, 10 men and 8 women, who were randomly assigned completed the study (Supplemental Figure 1). Participants had a mean ± SEM BMI of 28.8 ± 0.9 and were aged 53.1 ± 2.2 y (Table 1).

The mean ± SD bacterial OTU was 88,880 ± 47,427, with a maximum of 288,079 counts and a minimum of 35,957 counts/sample. At the phylum level, the majority of sequences were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (84.4%, 6.5%, and 5.4%, respectively). Thirty-five families were identified. Six families (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, an undefined family in the Clostridales order, Bacteroidaceae, Bifodobacteriaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae) comprised >90% of all families. Seventy-two genera were classified, with 22 representing >96% of sequences and 15 representing <1%; Bacteroides, Blautia, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Clostridiales, and unclassified Lachnospiraceae represented 74% of sequences. The mean ± SD archaeal OTU was 19,205 ± 42,075, with a maximum of 163,351 counts and a minimum of 3 counts/sample. Treatment did not affect archaea abundances. Fungal OTUs were present in lower abundances with a mean ± SD of 854 ± 2765 counts/sample. The minimum was 1 OTU (13 samples) and the maximum was 17,404 sequences. Treatment did not affect fungal abundances.
Walnut consumption did not affect bacterial α diversity measures, including phylogenetic diversity, observed OTUs, or richness and evenness. For β diversity, weighted principal coordinates analysis of UniFrac distances between samples based on their 97% OTU composition and abundances showed that bacterial communities were affected by walnut consumption (P = 0.03). At the phylum level, compared with the end of the control period, walnut consumption increased (P = 0.04) the relative abundance of Firmicutes and decreased (P = 0.02) the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (Table 2). Among bacterial genera, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Roseburia, and Dialister were increased (P < 0.05) at the end of the walnut intervention period compared with the control ( Table 2). Alternatively, the relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Dorea, Oscillospira, and Bifidobacterium were lower (P < 0.05) at the end of the control diet period than at the end of the walnut diet period (Table 2). The number of predicted bacterial butanoate metabolism genes was not different at the end of the walnut period (488,366 ± 168,601) compared with after the control period (570,743 ± 151,243) (P = 0.11).

Primary bile acids were not affected by treatment. Microbially derived secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, were reduced by 25% and 45%, respectively, in the walnut group compared with the control (P < 0.01) (Table 3). The number of predicted bacterial biosynthesis of secondary bile acids genes tended (P = 0.09) to be lower at the end of the walnut period (36,331 ± 12,256) than at the end of the control period (42,714 ± 11,605).

Serum total cholesterol concentrations were lower (P = 0.03) by 7 mg/dL (4% reduction) and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) by 9 mg/dL (7% reduction) after walnut consumption compared with the control (Table 4). Other metabolic variables were unaffected by walnut consumption. Serum campesterol was lower (P = 0.01) by 10 μmol/mmol (6% reduction), and lathosterol concentrations tended to be lower (P = 0.06) during the walnut period compared with the control (Table 5). There were no associations between the change in total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol and microbes affected by walnut consumption (Table 6). Lithocholic acid concentrations were positively associated with the relative abundances of Dorea (r = 0.46, P = 0.05) (Figure 1A) at the end of the walnut treatment period and tended to be negatively associated with Roseburia (r = −0.42, P = 0.08) (Figure 1B). There were no associations between deoxycholic acid concentrations and bacteria affected by walnut consumption (Table 7). Other predicted bacterial metabolism gene counts were unaffected by walnut consumption (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).
