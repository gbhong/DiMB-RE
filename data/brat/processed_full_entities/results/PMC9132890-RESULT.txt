Origin of consumed dietary fibers at baseline (g/d).
Sixteen subjects with CMR profile were included and randomized: 15 completed the cross-over study (9 men, 6 women) and were analyzed (Fig. 1). They were overweight/obese, showed an elevated waist circumference (abdominal obesity), and had neither fasting hyperglycemia, diabetes, elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, nor hypertension (Table 1). 90% were dyslipidemic (abnormal fasting concentration of triglycerides and/or total cholesterol and/or high- and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL and LDL cholesterol)). The mean daily fiber intake was 19 ± 4 g/day and the mean increase over the baseline of exhaled hydrogen concentration following the lactulose breath test was 84 ± 44 ppm. The compliance to study product consumption was high (96%) and dietary records showed that subjects followed the instructions they were given. No modification of their physical activity has been reported and they actually did not modify their energy, macronutrient and dietary fiber intakes – excluding CG – throughout the study (Table 2). At baseline, consumed fiber-rich food items were mainly from starchy food, vegetables and fruits (Fig. 2) and this was not modified throughout the study (data not shown). 
CG increased exhaled H2 and improved postprandial glycemic and lipemic profiles
Impacted postprandial metabolic parameters (n = 15). (A) iAUC of postprandial exhaled H2 following the ingestion of a fiber-enriched breakfast, iAUC of postprandial glycaemia (B), triglyceridemia (C) and triglyceridemia peak (D) following the ingestion of a standardized test meal challenge at lunch. Empty circles and horizontal lines within each box represent respectively the mean and median values. iAUC, incremental area under the curve; CG, chitin glucan; CTL, control. A mixed linear model for repeated measures with treatment, time, period and sequence as fixed variables and subjects as random effect has been performed. p values associated to CG effect assessed with the estimated treatment difference (ETD) and its 95% confidence interval are shown and considered as significant when < 0.05.
Anthropometry, body composition and fasting metabolic parameters (glycemia, insulinemia, homeostasic model assessment (HOMA), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), triglycerides, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and also resting metabolic rate were not differently impacted by CG and maltodextrin (as control) supplementations (Table S1). Compared to control, the 3-week supplementation of CG resulted in increase of the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of postprandial exhaled H2 (+ 722 ppm.min) following the ingestion of a fiber-enriched breakfast. Still, compared to control, we also showed that CG decreased the iAUC of postprandial glycemia (− 60 mM.min) and triglyceridemia (− 35 mM.min) and also the peak of triglyceridemia (-0.55 mM) in response to a standardized test meal challenge served at lunch (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3).

Data are expressed as mean percentage of relative abundance ± SD. To compare the shifts (i.e. the delta between the two treatments) and the baseline and endpoint, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed and considered as significant if p < 0.05. Bacterial taxa with significant p inter- and intragroup are presented in bold. For ASV identification, species name are indicated when the identity is > 98%.
After a 3-week supplementation, CG and control differently modified the relative abundance of 24 bacteria at different taxonomy levels. In particular, CG significantly decreased a family of bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria, increased Erysipelotrichaceae UCG.003, Ruminococcaceae UCG.005 and Eubacterium ventriosum group; while control did not impact these microbial taxa except for Eubacterium ventriosum group which was significantly increased (p < 0.05). 12 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were differently modified by both treatments. The relative abundance of an ASV belonging to Ruminococcus sp. was significantly decreased after control (p < 0.05) whereas it remained stable after CG supplementation (Table 3). Overall gut microbiota diversity (observed OTUs, Shannon and Pielou index, Bray–Curtis distance) and biomarkers of gut barrier function (fecal zonulin and calprotectin, plasmatic LBP) were not altered (Figure S1).
The concentrations of fecal metabolites (SCFA, BA, and LCFA) were not differently impacted by the two treatments (Figure S2).
Subgroup analysis according to fermentation profile
The improvement in postprandial glycemic profile following the supplementation in CG is only observed in High-H2 group
Exhaled H2 excretion profiles in response to lactulose breath test (n = 15). Subjects profile response to lactulose breath test from which two groups have been created: we computed Δ H2 = H2 peak − baseline; “High-H2” = subjects with Δ H2 > Δ H2 median; “Low-H2” = subjects with Δ H2 < Δ H2 median.
Impacted metabolic parameters according to gut fermentation profile (High-H2 (n = 8); Low-H2 (n = 7)). Empty circles and horizontal lines within each box represent respectively the mean and median values. A mixed linear model with treatment, time, period, sequence and subgroup as fixed variables and subjects as random effect has been performed once the interaction time*treatment*subgroup has been tested and showed significance. p values associated to CG effect assessed with the estimated treatment difference (ETD) and its 95% confidence interval is shown and considered as significant when < 0.05.
At inclusion, the results of the lactulose hydrogen breath test allowed to distinguish different profiles among the subjects: “High-H2” and “Low-H2” (Fig. 4). We then assessed if the impacts induced by the dietary interventions were different between the two subgroups. Among all assessed metabolic parameters, we found that the decrease in the iAUC of postprandial glycemia in response to the standardized test meal challenge, was only observed in “High-H2” subgroup (Fig. 5).
At baseline, “High-H2” and “Low-H2” subgroups differed by the fasting concentration of NEFA, the glycemic peak after the fiber-enriched breakfast, tAUC, iAUC, and peak of glycemia after the standardized test meal challenge, which were all higher in the “High-H2” subgroup (Table S2). Thus, subjects belonging to the “High-H2” group especially appeared to be presenting an impaired postprandial metabolic profile.

(A): Impacted microbial features in “High-H2” subgroup.

Data are expressed as mean percentage of relative abundance and presented as mean ± SD. To compare the shifts (i.e. the delta between the two treatments) and the baseline and endpoint, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed and considered as significant if p < 0.05. For ASV identification, species name is indicated when the identity is > 98%.
“High-H2” and “Low-H2” also differed at baseline in terms of abundance of some bacteria at different taxonomic levels (family, genus, ASV). Actually, compared to the “Low-H2” subgroup, the “High-H2” subgroup had a higher abundance of Actinomycetaceae, Tyzzerela, and a species belonging to the PAC001207_g genus, as well as a lower abundance of Acidaminococcaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanobrevibacter, Paraprevotella, and Methanobrevibacter smithii (Table 4). Of note, bacteria with lower abundances in the “High-H2” subgroup were mainly methanogenic bacteria. Subgroup analysis of gut microbiota composition after the dietary interventions showed that the bacterial features differently impacted by the two treatments were not the same according to subgroups but there was no specific effect of CG supplementation (Table 5).
Correlation analysis between bacterial features and metabolic parameters
Correlations analyses between altered microbial features and metabolic parameters. The deltas (after–before) following CG supplementation for each metabolic parameter and microbial feature which were differently impacted by the two interventions (including those impacted in subgroup analysis) are presented. iAUC: incremental area under the curve; gly: glycemia; TG: triglyceridemia; H2: hydrogen; bf: standardized breakfast; fm: Flexmeal (standardized test meal challenge). Spearman’s correlations were performed. * indicate the significant correlations (p value < 0.05).
To assess the relationship between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic profile alterations, we performed a correlation analysis between bacterial features and metabolic parameters which were differently altered by the dietary interventions (Fig. 6). Correlation analyses showed that the iAUC of exhaled H2 after the fiber-enriched breakfast correlated with Eubacterium coprostaligenes, Barnesiella, Faecalitalea and ASV belonging to Colinsella aerofaciens, and inversely correlated with Ruminococcus. The iAUC of glycemia after the standardized test meal challenge inversely correlated with Slackia. The iAUC of triglyceridemia after the standardized test meal challenge positively correlated with Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG.003, and inversely correlated with an ASV belonging to Eisenbergiella sp. Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae also positively correlated with the peak of triglyceridemia after the standardized test meal challenge.
