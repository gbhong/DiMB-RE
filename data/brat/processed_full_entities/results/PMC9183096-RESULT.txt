3.1. Diet and Drinking Water
The food intake of mice increased with age and tended to be stable 10 weeks after supplementation (Figure 1A(a)). No significant difference was found in the food intake between the two groups before the first 6 weeks, but the food intake of the BFS group increased faster than that of the control group at 6 weeks and especially at 10 weeks after supplementation. The average food intake of each mouse per day in the BFS group gradually increased compared with that in the control group, starting from the 10th week. As shown in Figure 1A(b), the amount of drinking water consumed by the two groups increased with age and stabilized at 10 weeks after supplementation. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups during the experiment.
3.2. Fasting Blood Glucose
Figure 1A(c) showed that the fasting blood glucose of the BFS group increased with age and stabilized at the 8th week after BFS. The fasting blood glucose of the control group remained stable during the experiment. No significant difference was observed in the fasting blood glucose between the two groups in the first 8 weeks after BFS. Starting from the 10th week, the fasting blood glucose of the BFS group was significantly higher than that of the control group (7.58 ± 1.78 vs. 5.12 ± 0.33, p < 0.05).
3.3. Body/Heart Weight and Cardiac Systolic Function
Figure 1A(d) shows that the body weights increased with age significantly in the first 8 weeks and stabilized at the 8th week. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of body weight in the first 7 weeks after supplementation. At 7 weeks, the body weight of the BFS group increased compared with that of the control group. Starting from the 10th week, the body weight of the BFS group significantly increased compared with that of the control group (26.82 ± 1.50 vs. 22.76 ± 1.38 g, p < 0.01). At the end of the experiment, all mice survived without withdrawal. Compared with the control group, the body and heart of the BFS group were heavier at the 12th week (Table 3), but no significant difference was observed in the ratio of heart/body weight between the two groups. Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the cardiac systolic function between the two groups.
3.4. Blood Lipid Level
Compared with the control group (Figure 1B(a)), the BFS group did not show any difference in HDL-C level (0.52 ± 0.14 vs. 0.48 ± 0.10 mmol/L, p > 0.05). The levels of LDL-C (5.94 ± 0.31 vs. 4.81 ± 0.37, p < 0.01) in the BFS group were higher than those in the control group (Figure 1B(b)). Compared with the control group (Figure 1B(c)), the BFS group did not show any difference in triglyceride level (TRIG: 2.49 ± 0.33 vs. 2.23 ± 0.24 mmol/L, p > 0.05). The levels of total cholesterol (TC: 24.71 ± 1.40 vs. 22.58 ± 1.27 mmol/L, p > 0.05) in the BFS group illustrated increasing trends compared with those in the control group.
3.5. Aorta Atherosclerotic Lesion
The aortic surface was stained using the Oil Red O method to observe the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in both groups (Figure 1C(a,b)). Compared with the control group (Figure 1C(c)), significantly increased extent of atherosclerotic lesions on the aortic surface was observed in the BFS group (12.08% ± 3.72% vs. 16.75% ± 3.69%, p < 0.05).
3.6. Inflammatory Marker Expression
The mRNA expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, CD36, and F4/80 in the duodenum and aorta tissues were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Compared with the control group, the BFS group showed significantly increased mRNA expression levels of CD36 (Figure 2A, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 5.10 ± 2.50, p < 0.05), F4/80 (Figure 2B, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 6.07 ± 3.34, p < 0.05), TLR2 (Figure 2C, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 5.61 ± 0.60, p < 0.01), and TLR4 (Figure 2D, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 6.74 ± 0.24, p < 0.01) in the duodenum tissue. The mRNA expression levels of CD36 (Figure 2E, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 5.61 ± 0.41, p < 0.01) and F4/80 (Figure 2F, 1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 8.34 ± 0.71, p < 0.01) in the BFS group’s aorta tissue were also significantly elevated.
3.7. Total Bacterial Abundance and Diversity
The abundance of most unique tags was 1 (Figure 3A,B). The OTU abundance statistics showed that the number of tags in the OTU from most samples was solely 1 (Figure 3C). The OTU species annotation (Figure 3D) indicated that more than 41% of tag sequences in samples could be annotated to the family level, whereas the number of tag sequences that could be annotated to the genus level was less than 14%. Therefore, the family level was chosen as the best classification level for the samples. At this level, a balance was reached for the two factors of species grade and the number of annotated tags.
The alpha diversity analysis showed no significant difference in the species of each group. The dilution curves of samples reached a plateau period or tended to be flat (Figure 3E), indicating equal levels of diversity within each sample. The beta diversity value of samples in the two groups was relatively large (Figure 3F), indicating that a significant difference in microbial signatures existed among the samples. PCA results (Figure 3G) suggested that the species structure of each group was similar.
3.8. Gut Microbial Abundance Changes
3.8.1. Bacteroidaceae Abundance
The Bacteroidaceae (BAC) abundance in the intestinal tract of mice decreased gradually with age. At the family level, the BAC abundance values in the BFS and control groups were 0.06% ± 0.0096% and 0.04% ± 0.0034% (p > 0.05), respectively, before supplementation (Figure 4A). BAC was not detected in the feces of the control group, but BAC abundance was 0.015% ± 0.015% in the BFS group (p < 0.01) at the 2nd week after supplementation (Figure 4B). At the 12th week (Figure 4C), the BAC abundance values in the feces of BFS and control groups were 0.0003% ± 0.00006% and 0.0020% ± 0.00045% (p > 0.05), respectively.
3.8.2. Lactobacillaceae Abundance
At the family level, the Lactobacillaceae (LAC) abundance values in the feces of mice in the BFS and control groups before supplementation were not significantly different (46.93% ± 34.11% vs. 67.74% ± 24.15%, p > 0.05) (Figure 4D). LAC abundance 4 weeks after supplementation significantly decreased in both groups compared with that before supplementation. LAC abundance decreased from 46.93% to 19.04% in the BFS group and from 67.74% to 26.17% in the control group (Figure 4E). LAC abundance in both groups continued to decline with age. Compared with that in the control group, LAC abundance in the BFS group significantly decreased (35% ± 14% vs. 9% ± 6%, p < 0.05) at 12 weeks after supplementation (Figure 4F).
3.8.3. Desulfovibrionaceae Abundance
At the family level, the Desulfovibrionaceae (DSV) was not detected in the feces of mice in both groups before supplementation. At 4 weeks after supplementation, DSV appeared in the feces of mice, but no significant difference was observed in both groups (1.07% ± 0.84% vs. 0.30% ± 0.08%, p > 0.05; Figure 4G). Subsequently, the DSV abundance increased with age. At 12 weeks, the DSV abundance in the BFS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (16.67% ± 5.98% vs. 3.49% ± 1.32%, p < 0.01; Figure 4H).
