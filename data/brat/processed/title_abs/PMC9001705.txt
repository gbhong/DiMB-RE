Gut microbiome responses to dietary intervention with hypocholesterolemic vegetable oils

Hypercholesterolemia is becoming a problem with increasing significance. Dietary vegetable oils may help to improve this condition due to presence of phytonutrients with potentially synergistic cholesterol-lowering effects. The objective of this 8-week double-blinded randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effects of consuming 30 g of two different blended cooking oils, rich in omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and phytonutrients, or refined olive oil on the intestinal microbiota in 126 volunteers with borderline hypercholesterolemia. Multi-factor analysis of relationships between the gut microbiota composition at various taxonomic ranks and the clinical trial parameters revealed the association between beneficial effects of the dietary intervention on the blood lipid profile with abundance of Clostridia class of the gut microbiota. This microbiota feature was upregulated in the course of the dietary intervention and associated with various plasma markers of metabolic health status, such as Triglycerides, Apolipoprotein B and Total Cholesterol to HDL ratio in a beneficial way. The relative abundance of a single species—Clostridium leptum—highly increased during the dietary intervention in all the three study groups. The oil blend with the highest concentration of omega-3 PUFA is associated with faster and more robust responses of the intestinal microbiota, including elevation of alpha-diversity. Butyrate production is being discussed as a plausible process mediating the observed beneficial influence on the plasma lipid profile. Causal mediation analysis suggested that Clostridium genus rather than the higher rank of the phylogeny—Clostridia class—may be involved in the diet-induced improvements of the blood lipid profile.
