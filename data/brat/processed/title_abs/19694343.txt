The effect of a new symbiotic formulation on plasma levels and peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with ulcerative colitis: a pilot study.

BACKGROUND: During intestinal inflammation white blood cells are recruited from the blood, and they represent the major contributors to tissue perpetuation of inflammation via their production of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus Paracasei B 20160 versus placebo, on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-8, IL-1beta and IL-10 and on mRNA lymphomonocyte expression of TNFalpha, IL-8 and IL-1beta in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients entered the study with histologically proven not complicated ulcerative colitis, treated with mesalazine. Patients were treated for 8 weeks (9 with symbiotic and 9 with placebo). Serum levels of IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-1beta and IL-10 were measured using a commercially available sandwich ELISA kit. RT-PCR analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from peripheral lymphomonocytes. RESULTS: In basal condition, there was an increase of serum levels of TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-8. The treatment with symbiotic significantly decreased serum levels of the last two cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8). In lymphocytes, the treatment with the symbiotic don't significantly reduced the mRNA expression of TNFalpha and IL-1beta, while that of IL-8 was strongly and significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei significantly improves the plasma and lymphocyte content of some proinflammatory cytokines.
