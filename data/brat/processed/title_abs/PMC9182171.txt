Effects of Poncirin, a Citrus Flavonoid and Its Aglycone, Isosakuranetin, on the Gut Microbial Diversity and Metabolomics in Mice

Poncirin (PC) and its aglycone, isosakuranetin (IR), occur naturally in citrus fruits. This study aimed to explore the pathways behind the different health benefits of PC and IR by evaluating the effect of these two bioactive flavonoids on the gut microbial diversity and metabolomics of mice. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the alteration of gut microbiota in mice after PC and IR intervention. The metabolic impact of PC and IR in mice were studied using a metabolomics approach based on LC-MS analysis. Results showed that, after 7 days intervention, PC and IR multiplied the abundance of Parabacteroides in miceâ€™s intestinal tracts by 1.2 and 1.0 times, respectively. PC increased the abundance of Bacteroides by 2.4 times. IR reduced the Allobaculum abundance by 1.0 time and increased Alloprevotella abundance by 1.5 times. When mice were given PC, their fecal acetic acid level increased by 1.8 times, while their isobutyric and isovaleric acid content increased by 1.2 and 1.3 times, respectively. Supplementation with IR had no significant effect on the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the feces of mice. The potential urine biomarkers of mice in the PC group were involved in the digestion and absorption of protein and carbohydrate, as well as the metabolism of amino acids, such as glycine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, D-arginine, D-ornithine, etc. IR mainly affected the amino acid metabolic pathways in mice, including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, histidine metabolism, D-glutamate metabolism, etc. This study provided valuable clues for future research on the health promoting mechanisms of PC and IR.
