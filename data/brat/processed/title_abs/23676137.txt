Effects of lactulose supplementation on performance, blood profiles, excreta microbial shedding of Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli, relative organ weight and excreta noxious gas contents in broilers.

This study was to evaluate the effects of lactulose supplementation on performance, blood profiles, excreta microbial shedding of Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli, relative organ weight and excreta noxious gas contents in broilers. A total of 720 ROSS 308 broilers with a body weight of 46 Â± 0.1 g (1 day of age) were used in a 28-d experiment. Broilers were randomly allotted to 4 experiment diets with 12 replicate pens and 15 birds per pen. Dietary treatments were as follows: NC, negative control (without antibiotic); PC, NC + 0.1% tiamulin; L1, NC + 0.1% lactulose; and L2, NC + 0.2% lactulose. Broilers were fed with phase 1 (1-8 day), phase 2 (9-18 day) and phase 3 (19-28 day) diets in the form of mash. During day 1-8, broilers fed the PC and L2 diets had higher (p < 0.05) body weight gain than those fed the NC diet. During day 19-28, broilers fed the L1 and L2 diets had lower (p < 0.05) feed intake than those fed the NC diet. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was decreased (p < 0.05) in L1 treatment compared with NC treatment. Overall, the FCR was improved (p < 0.05) in all supplementation treatments compared with NC treatment. The apparently metabolizable nitrogen in L1 treatment was higher (p < 0.05) than that in NC treatment at day 28. The excreta Lactobacillus was increased and E. coli was decreased in PC and L2 treatments compared with NC treatment at day 28 (p < 0.05). The excreta NH3, H2S and acetic acid contents were decreased (p < 0.05) in L1 and L2 treatments compared with NC treatment. The relative weight of abdominal fat of broilers fed the PC diet was lowest (p < 0.05) compared with other treatments. In conclusion, this study indicated that dietary supplementation of 0.1% or 0.2% lactulose could improve growth performance, decrease excreta E. coli and excreta NH3 and H2S contents.
