The Neuroprotective Effects of Spray-Dried Porcine Plasma Supplementation Involve the Microbiota−Gut−Brain Axis

Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) reduces the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hallmarks in SAMP8 mice. Since gut microbiota can play a critical role in the AD progression, we have studied if the neuroprotective effects of SDP involve the microbiota−gut−brain axis. Experiments were performed on two-month-old SAMP8 mice fed a standard diet and on six-month-old SAMP8 mice fed a control diet or an 8% SDP supplemented diet for four months. Senescence impaired short- and long-term memory, reduced cortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) abundance, increased interleukin (Il)-1β, Il-6, and Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2) expression, and reduced transforming growth factor β (Tgf-β) expression and IL-10 concentration (all p < 0.05) and these effects were mitigated by SDP (all p < 0.05). Aging also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and colon (all p < 0.05). SDP attenuated both colonic and systemic inflammation in aged mice (all p < 0.05). SDP induced the proliferation of health-promoting bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, while reducing the abundance of inflammation-associated bacteria, such as Johnsonella and Erysipelothrix (both q < 0.1). In conclusion, SDP has mucosal and systemic anti-inflammatory effects as well as neuroprotective properties in senescent mice; these effects are well correlated with SDP promotion of the abundance of probiotic species, which indicates that the gut–brain axis could be involved in the peripheral effects of SDP supplementation.
