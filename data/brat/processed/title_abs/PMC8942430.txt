Increasing the diversity of dietary fibers in a daily-consumed bread modifies gut microbiota and metabolic profile in subjects at cardiometabolic risk

ABSTRACT
Some cardiometabolic risk factors such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance are known to be associated with low gut microbiota richness. A link between gut microbiota richness and the diversity of consumed dietary fibers (DF) has also been reported. We introduced a larger diversity of consumed DF by using a daily consumed bread in subjects at cardiometabolic risk and assessed the impacts on the composition and functions of gut microbiota as well as on cardiometabolic profile. Thirty-nine subjects at cardiometabolic risk were included in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, twice 8-week study, and consumed daily 150 g of standard bread or enriched with a 7-dietary fiber mixture (5.55 g and 16.05 g of fibers, respectively). Before and after intervention, stool samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis from species determination down to gene-level abundance using shotgun metagenomics, and cardiometabolic profile was assessed. Multi-fiber bread consumption significantly decreased Bacteroides vulgatus, whereas it increased Parabacteroides distasonis, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, an unclassified Acutalibacteraceae and an unclassified Eisenbergiella (q < 0.1). The fraction of gut microbiota carrying the gene coding for five families/subfamilies of glycoside hydrolases (CAZymes) were also increased and negatively correlated with peaks and total/incremental area under curve (tAUC/iAUC) of postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. Compared to control bread, multi-fiber bread decreased total cholesterol (−0.42 mM; q < 0.01), LDL cholesterol (−0.36 mM; q < 0.01), insulin (−2.77 mIU/l; q < 0.05), and HOMA (−0.78; q < 0.05). In conclusion, increasing the diversity of DF in a daily consumed product modifies gut microbiota composition and function and could be a relevant nutritional tool to improve cardiometabolic profile.
