Bacteroides fragilis Supplementation Deteriorated Metabolic Dysfunction, Inflammation, and Aorta Atherosclerosis by Inducing Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis in Animal Model

Background: The gut microbial ecosystem is an important factor that regulates host health and the onset of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, which are important risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the links among diet, microbiota composition, and atherosclerotic progression are unclear. Methods and results: Four-week-old mice (-/- mice, C57Bl/6) were randomly divided into two groups, namely, supplementation with culture medium (control, CTR) and Bacteroides fragilis (BFS), and were fed a high-fat diet. The gut microbiota abundance in feces was evaluated using the 16S rDNA cloning library construction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. The atherosclerotic lesion was estimated using Oil Red O staining. Levels of CD36, a scavenger receptor implicated in atherosclerosis, and F4/80, a macrophage marker in small intestine, were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the CTR group, the BFS group showed increased food intake, fasting blood glucose level, body weight, low-density lipoprotein level, and aortic atherosclerotic lesions. BFS dramatically reduced Lactobacillaceae (LAC) abundance and increased Desulfovibrionaceae (DSV) abundance. The mRNA expression levels of CD36 and F4/80 in small intestine and aorta tissue in the BFS group were significantly higher than those in the CTR group. Conclusions: gut microbiota dysbiosis was induced by BFS. It was characterized by reduced LAC and increased DSV abundance and led to the deterioration of glucose/lipid metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory response, which likely promoted aorta plaque formation and the progression of atherosclerosis.
