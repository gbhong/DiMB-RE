As a result of the analysis of 32 fecal samples from mice from before and after two, four and six weeks of the addition of two probiotic supplements, a total of 81,385 unique reads were obtained, which corresponded to 99 genera of bacteria. A complete list of the discovered genera is presented in Supplementary Materials (Table S1). All genera that had an average abundance of less than 0.005 were combined into the “Other” group, thus forming a list of the 32 most common genera, which is presented for each sample from the lactic acid bacteria (Figure 2) and bifidobacteria (Figure 3) groups.
For the group of mice that received lactic acid bacteria, the most common genus was Prevotella, with an abundance of 0.39 ± 0.04. The next in order of abundance were: Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (0.07 ± 0.01); Bacteroides (0.06 ± 0.01); Lactobacillus (0.05 ± 0.01); Akkermansia (0.05 ± 0.02); Alistipes (0.05 ± 0.01); Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group (0.04 ± 0.01); Helicobacter (0.02 ± 0.01); Alloprevotella (0.02 ± 0.004); Dubosiella (0.02 ± 0.01); Colidextribacter (0.02 ± 0.004); and Muribaculum (0.02 ± 0.002). The average numbers of Ruminococcus, Parasutterella, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, Odoribacter, Oscillibacter and Intestinimonas were within 0.01–0.02. The average number of other genera was less than 0.01.
For the group of mice that received bifidobacteria, the most common genus was also Prevotella (0.2 ± 0.04) and the second largest was Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 (0.08 ± 0.04). However, the further distribution of genus was significantly different from that of the group of mice that received lactic acid bacteria. The remaining genera of bacteria were distributed, in terms of abundance, as follows: Ileibacterium (0.07 ± 0.02); Allobaculum (0.05 ± 0.02); Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (0.05 ± 0.01); Muribaculum (0.05 ± 0.01); Akkermansia (0.04 ± 0.02); Parasutterella (0.04 ± 0.01); Bifidobacterium (0.04 ± 0.02); Dubosiella (0.03 ± 0.01); and Helicobacter (0.03 ± 0.01). The average relative abundance of the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Colidextribacter, Bacteroides, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Intestinimonas, Oscillibacter, Ruminococcus, Acetatifactor and Odoribacter was within 0.01–0.02 and the average number of other genera was less than 0.01.
In addition, we estimated the way in which changes in alpha diversity occurred in mice that received lactic acid bacteria (Figure 4) and bifidobacteria (Figure 5) using the Shannon index.
Figure 4 shows that the maximum value of alpha diversity in the group of mice before the addition of members of Lactobacillaceae family was 3.11 ± 0.04: two weeks later, it was 2.92 ± 0.06; four weeks later, it was 2.11 ± 0.07; and six weeks later, it was 2.00 ± 0.08. Only the difference between the fourth and sixth weeks was not statistically significant.
Until the fourth week, we observed a decrease in alpha diversity. Before taking bifidobacteria, the indicator was 3.18 ± 0.05. Then, two weeks later, it became 3.0037 ± 0.0474 and by the fourth week, it reached 2.60 ± 0.09. However, after six weeks, the alpha diversity reached its maximum value of 3.62 ± 0.05.
A phylogenetic analysis of the microbiome of the studied groups at the phylum level also revealed several differences in bacterial composition. In the mice that received members of the Lactobacillaceae family during the feeding, the phylum Bacteroidota increased: 0.48 ± 0.06 before the addition of the probiotic; 0.58 ± 0.07 after two weeks of supplements; 0.62 ± 0.05 after four weeks for supplements; and 0.73 ± 0.05 after six weeks of supplements. At the same time, the phylum Firmicutes decreased: 0.41 ± 0.08 before the addition of the probiotic; 0.35 ± 0.05 after two weeks of supplements; 0.23 ± 0.03 after four weeks of supplements; and 0.20 ± 0.04 after six weeks of supplements. These two phyla accounted for the main share of the bacterial composition of the gut of the mice. Bacteroidota remained the dominant phylum throughout the lactic acid bacteria feeding.
In the mice that received bifidobacteria during the study, an uneven distribution of bacterial phyla was observed. As in the lactic acid bacteria-treated mice, the two main phyla throughout the study were Firmicutes (the abundance of which was 0.51 ± 0.06 before probiotic addition, 0.49 ± 0.05 after two weeks of supplements, 0.47 ± 0.12 after four weeks of supplements and 0.48 ± 0.09 after six weeks of supplements) and Bacteroidota (0.37 ± 0.04 before the addition of the probiotic, 0.19 ± 0.03 after two weeks of supplements, 0.44 ± 0.11 after four weeks of supplements and 0.34 ± 0.06 after six weeks of supplements).
We also estimated the statistical significance of differences in the microbiome composition at the phylum level after two, four and six weeks of lactic acid bacteria feeding with a control group of mice. It was found that after two weeks of feeding with probiotics, statistically significant changes were observed for two bacterial phyla: Campylobacterota, the abundance of which decreased 2.71-fold, and Patescibacteria, the abundance of which increased 4.07-fold compared to the control group (p < 0.01 in both cases).
After four weeks of feeding with lactic acid bacteria, statistically significant changes were observed for the following phyla: Bacteroidota, which increased 1.41-fold (p < 0.001); Verrucomicrobiota, which increased 4.15-fold (p < 0.001); Campylobacterota, which decreased 4.4-fold (p < 0.001); and Deferribacterota, which decreased 4.7-fold (p < 0.01) (Figure 6).
After six weeks of feeding with lactic acid bacteria, statistically significant changes were observed for the following: Bacteroidota, which increased 1.25-fold (p < 0.01); Cyanobacteria, which decreased 2.64-fold (p < 0.01); and Abditibacteriota, which significantly increased 24.97-fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 7).
The statistically significant differences in the microbiome composition at the phylum level that were revealed after two weeks of feeding with a probiotic mixture of bifidobacteria showed an increase in the number of phyla Actinobacteriota (4.2-fold (p < 0.001)) and Spirochaetota (4.26-fold (p < 0.01)).
After four weeks of probiotic feeding, the mice showed a significant decrease in the number of Abditibacteriota phyla (19.46-fold (p < 0.001)) and Verrucomicrobiota (2.9-fold (p < 0.01)), as well as an increase in the abundance of the genera Bacteroidota (1.21-fold (p < 0.001)) and Actinobacteriota (2.69-fold (p < 0.01)), compared to the control (Figure 8).
After six weeks of adding bifidobacteria to the feed, we continued to observe a decrease in the phylum Verrucomicrobiota (2.62-fold (p < 0.01)) and the phylum Desulfobacterota (1.92-fold) compared to the control group (p < 0.05), while the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria increased 1.77-fold (p < 0.001) and Actinobacteriota increased 3.17-fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 9).
An analysis of the changes at the genus level in the composition of the microbiome of mice that received lactic acid bacteria showed that after two weeks, there were statistically significant changes, which were characterized by an increase in the abundance of the genera Ruminococcus (3.57-fold), Dubosiella (4.56-fold) and Candidatus Saccharimonas (4.7-fold) and a decrease in Helicobacter (2.43-fold) and Nocardioides (20.5-fold) compared to the microbiome before the addition of lactic acid bacteria to the feed (p < 0.001 in all cases) (Figure 10).
Four weeks later, we registered a decrease in the genera Nocardioides (19.55-fold (p < 0.01)), Mucispirillum (4.05-fold (p < 0.01)) and Helicobacter (3.82-fold (p < 0.001)), as well as an increase in the genera Prevotella (2.72-fold (p < 0.001)), Alloprevotella (2.93-fold (p < 0.001)), Akkermansia (4.75-fold (p < 0.001)), Faecalibaculum (4.99-fold (p < 0.01)) and Veillonella (5.97-fold (p < 0.001)), compared to the microbiome before the addition of lactic acid bacteria to the feed (Figure 11).
After six weeks, in the lactic acid bacteria-fed mice, we observed a 20.39-fold decrease in the Nocardioides (** p < 0.01) and a 6.08-fold decrease in the Lactococcus (*** p < 0.001) genera, as well as a 2.59-fold increase in the Prevotella (*** p < 0.001), a 4.31-fold increase in the Lachnospiraceae UCG-003 (*** p < 0.001) and a 24.91-fold increase in the Abditibacterium (*** p < 0.001) genera, compared to the control (Figure 12).
Statistically significant decreases were revealed two weeks later in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 (5.01-fold (p < 0.001)), Prevotellaceae Ga6A1 group (3.41-fold (p < 0.001)), Acetatifactor (3.33-fold (p < 0.01)), Anaerotruncus (3.32-fold (p < 0.01)), Lachnospiraceae ASF356 (3.26-fold (p < 0.05)), Tyzzerella (3.04-fold (p < 0.05)), Odoribacter (2.45-fold (p < 0.001)), Prevotella (2.43-fold (p < 0.001)), Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group (1.95-fold (p < 0.05)) and Alistipes (1.56-fold (p < 0.001)). Statistically significant increases were observed in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (1.47-fold (p < 0.05)), Lactobacillus (2.37-fold (p < 0.01)), Candidatus Saccharimonas (3.2-fold (p < 0.01)), Lachnospiraceae A2 (3.27-fold (p < 0.05)), Muribaculum (3.42-fold (p < 0.001)), Brachyspira (3.86-fold (p < 0.01)) and Bifidobacterium (5.04-fold (p < 0.001)) (Figure 13).
Four weeks later, we observed a 20.3-fold decrease in Nocardioides, a 19.1-fold decrease in Abditibacterium, a 3.59-fold increase in Akkermansia and a 2.78-fold increase in Muribaculum (*** p < 0.001 for all changes) (Figure 14).
After six weeks of probiotic supplementation, the abundance of the genus Escherichia-Shigella significantly increased 4.74-fold (p < 0.001) compared to the microbiome before the addition of bifidobacteria to the feed.
