Assembly of a multi-generational Asian-American immigrant cohort
We recruited 514 healthy Hmong and Karen female individuals (aged 18–78, see Methods for full exclusion criteria) who either (1) were living in Thailand (HmongThai, KarenThai; n = 179), (2) were born in Southeast Asia and had moved to the U.S. (Hmong1st, Karen1st; n = 281), or (3) were born in the U.S. and whose parents were born in Southeast Asia (Hmong2nd; n = 54) (Figure 1A). We also recruited healthy European American female individuals to serve as U.S. controls (Controls; n = 36) (Figure 1A). We limited our study to women based on insight from our Hmong community advisory board that substantially more Hmong women than men were relocating to U.S. Participants in each sample group were recruited into lean or overweight/obese body mass index (BMI) class stratifications (BMI < 25 or BMI ≥ 25, respectively) (Table S1). We recruited eligible individuals throughout the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, and at two locations in Thailand: a rural village in Chiang Mai province (Khun Chang Khian), and a refugee camp in Tak province (Mae La) (Figure S1A) in 2016 and 2017.
Bilingual-bicultural research teams collected migration and medical histories (Table S2), anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference), 24-hour dietary recalls, and a single stool sample from all participants. Karen participants who were about to leave Thailand for the U.S. or who had arrived in the U.S. within 2 months were invited to participate in a longitudinal sub-study in which 24-hour dietary recalls and stool samples were collected monthly for 6 months (Figure 1A). We collected a total of 673 stool samples comprising 531 single- and 142 multiple-time-point collections. Consistent with the previously observed high rate of obesity in U.S. immigrants (see Introduction), obesity prevalence relative to overweight status in our cohort increased after a decade in the U.S. in the Hmong1st group (Chi-square test statistic = 5.23, P = 0.022) (Figure 1B). There was not a sufficient number of Karen subjects with long-term U.S. residence to test for changes in prevalence of obesity.
To be able to associate gut microbiome variation with dietary intake, we collected 24-hour dietary recalls from all participants and analyzed macronutrient content using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) SuperTracker food record system and published literature. We utilized the hierarchical format of food codes derived from the USDA’s Food Nutrient and Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to categorize foods into a tree structure where more closely related foods were grouped together (Figure 1C). These groupings allowed us to share statistical strength across closely related foods to complement dietary analysis of macronutrients, much in the way that phylogenetic beta-diversity analysis complements taxonomy-based profiles of microbiomes. Foods reported by participants that were not found in any USDA database (n = 72, Table S3) were manually inserted into the hierarchical food tree, allowing us to account for all foods reported by all participants. We confirmed our ability to discriminate between the Karen1st, Hmong1st, and Hmong2nd group diets using tree-based distances (Figure S1B), identifying a stark increase in the variety of foods eaten by second-generation Hmong relative to Hmong in Thailand (Figure 1C) (t-test of phylogenetic diversity P = 4.828e-10).
U.S. immigration is associated with loss of native gut microbiome species
We performed amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region on 550 stool samples (one sample per participant). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of unweighted UniFrac distances revealed that Hmong and Karen harbor distinct gut microbial compositions regardless of country of residence, yet their microbiomes converge toward European American microbiomes after relocating to the U.S. (ANOSIM R=0.25, P=0.001), with second-generation Hmong and European American microbiomes sharing nearly identical cluster centroids (Figure 2A). Interestingly, all U.S. immigrant groups had higher interindividual variation than their Thai counterparts (t-test Hmong1st vs. HmongThai P = 1.2e-12; Hmong1st vs. HmongThai P = 6.5e-4; Karen1st vs. KarenThai P = 4.9e-37). The first-generation immigrants with the most perturbed microbiomes (most distant tertile from Thai groups) had both higher age (t-test P = 0.0013) and longer time in the U.S. (t-test P = 0.00079) than those with the least perturbed microbiomes (least distant tertile from Thai groups).
Microbial diversity and richness were highest in Thailand and decreased with each generation of residence in the U.S. (Tukey’s HSD, p < 0.01, Figure 2B). As in other studies, we found that lower phylogenetic diversity was associated with obesity across all major study groups (unbalanced two-way ANOVA, P = 0.0044, Figure 2B), even after stratification by ethnicity (Tukey’s HSD, p < 0.01, Figure S2A). Furthermore, we observed a consistent loss of certain native bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among first-generation Hmong (Figure 2C). Although 7 of the 10 most prevalent OTUs found in HmongThai were also found at similar levels in Hmong1st, others such as otu1812
(Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) incurred a 45% loss in prevalence (Fisher’s exact test, FDR-corrected q = 3.05E-14) (Table S4). Prevalence-abundance curve analysis showed that many OTUs that were highly prevalent (> 75% prevalence) in Thai-resident individuals had both decreased abundance and prevalence in 1st-generation U.S. residents (paired t-test, area under the prevalence-log-abundance curve, HmongThai vs. Hmong1st, P < 2.2×10−16) (Figure 2D). 28 OTUs incurred at least a 50% loss in prevalence among first-generation Hmong, with more than half of them belonging to the genus Prevotella (Table S4).
Bacteroides strains displace Prevotella strains across generations in the U.S.
The Western-associated genus Bacteroides increasingly displaced the non-Western-associated genus Prevotella across generations in the U.S. (Figure 3A). The ratio of Bacteroides to Prevotella was lowest in Thailand-resident individuals, highest in U.S.-born European Americans, and increased in a stepwise fashion from first-generation Karen, to first-generation Hmong, to second-generation Hmong (unbalanced two-way ANOVA, Resident Continent P=3.4e−13, Birth Continent P=0.00085, Ethnicity P=5.5e−12). This progression corresponded with the time that these groups had spent in the U.S.
Using deep shotgun metagenomics on 55 samples (mean 22,406,875 reads/sample) from Hmong in Thailand, newly arrived Karen, long-term (> 30 years) U.S. resident Hmong, and Controls, we profiled strain-level variation within Bacteroides and Prevotella. We aligned shotgun metagenomic sequences against all 256 Bacteroides genomes and 153 Prevotella genomes in RefSeq version 87, retaining any strains with at least 50% genome coverage in at least one sample. We found that U.S. Controls had varied Bacteroides strain profiles, while those with Prevotella had only a single strain of P. copri (Figure 3B). Conversely, Thailand-based individuals carried up to 4 strains of Prevotella, with low abundance and generally low genomic coverage of Bacteroides strains, possibly due to lack of related strains in the database. Long-term U.S.-resident Hmong displayed an intermediate profile, carrying a variety of Bacteroides strains and, in several individuals, multiple Prevotella strains. Prevalence-abundance curves for the Bacteroides and Prevotella strains with the largest change in overall prevalence between HmongThai and Hmong1st showed marked loss of Prevotella strains accompanied by an expansion of pre-existing low-abundance Bacteroides strains following U.S. immigration (Figure S2B).
U.S. immigrants lose enzymes associated with plant fiber degradation
We identified differences in functional pathways between HmongThai and long-term U.S. resident Hmong1st (> 30 years residence) using shotgun metagenomics data (ANOVA, FDR-corrected q < 0.10, Figure S3A). First-generation Hmong harbored microbiomes with increased capacity for sucrose degradation, glycerol degradation, glucose/xylose degradation, and glucose fermentation to lactate, potentially related to increased consumption of more sugary foods, although most sucrose and glucose would not be expected to reach the lower GI tract. In HmongThai, we found an enrichment of pathways relating to the degradation of complex carbohydrates, including β-(1,4)-mannan degradation and starch degradation. In order to better understand the substrates degraded by these pathways that either are lost or below the detection limit in U.S. immigrants, we assembled the shotgun data into scaffolds and annotated carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZymes). We found significant shifts in abundance of 58 CAZymes across the HmongThai, Hmong1st, and Control groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR-corrected q < 0.05, Figure 3C), including three beta-glucan-targeting glycoside hydrolases (GH17, GH64, GH87) that were highly abundant in the Thailand group but almost entirely unobserved in the U.S. groups. Loss of these glycoside hydrolases may be associated with loss of dietary fiber sources that promote persistence of the organisms that harbor these enzymes, reducing the ability of the microbiota to degrade these dietary fibers.
These 3 glycoside hydrolases predominantly originated from Prevotella copri (42 ± 11.1%, Figure S3B), supporting the hypothesis that loss of Prevotella strains following U.S. immigration drove loss of plant fiber degradation capability. We also observed a loss of GH5 and GH26 glycoside hydrolases from HmongThai to Hmong1st and U.S. controls, which indicates a loss of cellulose, beta-mannan and possible xyloglucan degradative potential. Beta-mannans are present in seeds, kernels, and corms, such as palm, coconut, and konjac, and xyloglucan is found most abundantly in tamarind, which, interestingly, are food ingredients prevalent in Southeast Asia. The loss of glycoside hydrolases for degrading cellulose, a plant cell-wall component, ws another indication that the microbiota of post-immigration individuals had lost some of their ability to degrade plant-derived fibers. These findings parallel previous findings in a mouse model demonstrating that the microbiomes of mice deprived of dietary fiber lost the capability to produce certain glycoside hydrolases.
Dietary acculturation partly explains microbiome acculturation
We observed significant differences across study groups in the consumption of macronutrients commonly associated with a Western diet: sugars, fats, and protein (unbalanced two-way ANOVA, p < 0.01, Figure 4A, Figure S4). There were no significant associations between fiber content and the microbiome, possibly due to the many uncharacterized polysaccharides present in different foods. PCoA of diet-based unweighted UniFrac revealed distinct separation by sample group (ANOSIM R=0.29, P=0.001, Figure 4B) and a gradient of dietary acculturation along PC1 (Table S6). First- and second-generation Hmong had similar food choice profiles (Figure 4B), while U.S. controls shared few foods with other groups and consumed almost tenfold less white rice than other groups (Figure S5). Although the microbiomes of U.S. control and second-generation Hmong clustered together (Figure 2A), their diets did not (Figure 4B).
Overall dietary profile was significantly associated with overall microbiome profile across individuals (Procrustes test P=0.001, n=999 permutations) (Figure S5C), but constrained ordination of the microbiome by the first 5 principal coordinates of diet variation revealed that diet explained a relatively small fraction (16.8%) of the total variation explained in the microbiome PCoA (Figure 4C). Thus, we found that diet was likely not the sole contributor to the observed gut microbiome changes in our cohort, although it is possible that dietary variation explains substantially more microbiome variation in this cohort than we are able to determine due to our limited knowledge of precise polysaccharide and other nutrient content of the foods, and due to complex individualized diet-microbiome interactions.
Gut biodiversity decreases according to duration of residence in the U.S.
After finding that U.S. residence was associated with a major shift in dominant taxa in the microbiome (Figure 3A), we decided to test whether U.S. residents experienced more profound changes in microbiome composition the longer they lived in the U.S. In a PCoA of unweighted UniFrac microbiome-based distances, we found that time spent in the U.S. was strongly correlated with the first principal coordinate axis (⍴ = 0.62, p < 2.2e-16, Figure 5A). Conversely, gut biodiversity, as measured by Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, was negatively correlated with PC1 (⍴ = −0.34, p < 3.19e-09, Figure 5B), even while controlling for BMI in the Hmong (multiple linear regression, Years in US β = −0.18, P = 0.0275, Figure 5C). We note that age was highly correlated with years in the U.S. in the Hmong1st group (Pearson correlation ρ = .444, P = 4.5e−9), and therefore age is also strongly correlated with loss of diversity (multiple linear regression, Age β = −.38, P = 2.2e−6). Age was not significantly correlated with diversity in any of the other groups (Pearson correlation HmongThai P = .065, Hmong2nd P = .79, Control P = .37). Thus, we found evidence that increased duration of U.S. residence is associated with decreased microbiome diversity, but that further study is needed to separate the effects of age and duration of U.S. residence.
Prevotella displacement continues for more than one decade
The longer immigrants spend living in the U.S., the more their microbiomes compositions diverge from their Thai counterparts and converge toward European Americans (Spearman correlation, ρ = −0.41, P = 1.3e−12 and ρ = 0.35, P = 1.2e−09, respectively) (Figure 6A), with continued displacement of Prevotella with Bacteroides (Spearman’s correlation, ρ = 0.44, P = 8.76e-15, Figure 6B) over time. We confirmed that this significant association persisted after stratifying the first-generation immigrants by ethnicity, despite the shorter time frame of U.S. residence in first-generation Karen (Spearman’s correlation, Hmong ρ = 0.47, P = 8.16e-19; Karen ρ = 0.19, P = 0.023, Figure 6B inset). As in the case of diversity above, we note that age is highly correlated with years in the U.S.. However, we used the European American group as a control group to test for association of age with similarity to the HmongThai reference group and found no association (P = 0.57) (Figure S6A), and the B:P ratio in first-generation immigrants was significantly associated with years in the U.S. regardless of age (multiple linear regression, Years in US β = 0.096, P = 0.0094; Age β = 0.039, P = 0.0065) (Figure S6B). These findings show that changes to the dominant members of the gut microbiome begin during the first decade of U.S. residence, and continue for multiple decades.
Microbiome Westernization begins within 9 months after immigration
To understand whether changes in the gut microbiome can be detected immediately after relocation to the U.S., we examined the gut microbiomes of 19 newly arrived Karen over their first 6–9 months of U.S. residence. Within this short time frame all but one participant gained weight (paired t-test, P=8.3e-05, Figure 7A), and protein consumption increased (paired t-test, FDR-adjusted q=0.048, Figure 7B), while the total variety of foods consumed decreased (paired t-test, P=0.017, Figure 7C), suggesting a period of acclimation to newly available foods. This is in contrast to the Hmong1st group whose diet diversity tended to increase following U.S. immigration (Figure S7B). Hmong participants’ diets may be more acculturated due to the longer duration of residence of the Hmong community (mean time U.S. residence 20.2 years among study participants) when compared to the Karen community (mean time U.S. residence 1.9 years among study participants). Hmong1st diets tend to be more similar on average than the Karen1st diets to the European American diets (t-test of mean tree-based diet distance to European American group P = 0.028). We again observed the displacement of Prevotella by Bacteroides (paired t-test, P=0.0013, Figure 7D) within this longitudinal cohort, in many cases involving a ten-fold increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella ratio, indicating that microbiome westernization begins immediately after arrival to the U.S.
This longitudinal cohort also included six Karen participants from whom we collected samples in Thailand, prior to their relocation to the U.S. Using deep shotgun metagenomics sequencing on 13 samples from these 6 participants, we found that Prevotella and Bacteroides strain profiles remained largely stable over 6 months but sometimes underwent substantial changes (subject highlighted in blue, Figure 7E). We observed in general that relocating to the U.S. induced a variety of short-term gut microbiome responses including disruption to the gut microbiome immediately after arrival in two subjects (ID.273 and ID.304), expansion of opportunistic pathogens (ID.305), gut disruption several months after arrival (ID.275), and stability (ID.274, ID.308) (Figure 7F). Thus, we found that short-term responses to immigration of overall microbiome composition were variable across individuals, but the displacement of dominant native taxa with dominant U.S. taxa begins within 6 to 9 months of U.S. residence.
