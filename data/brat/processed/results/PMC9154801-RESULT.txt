This study included 129 Korean individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD (NAFL, n = 70; NASH, n = 59) and 75 controls without NAFLD (Supplementary Table 1). Subjects were divided into two groups according to their carbohydrate intake (high carbohydrate [HC] group, energy intake from carbohydrates ≥70%; low carbohydrate [LC] group, energy intake from carbohydrates <70%). Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the HC and LC groups (Table 1). Subjects were then subdivided into three subgroups (N0–2) according to their NAFLD activity score (NAS). The subgroups were categorized as non-NASH (N0), borderline NASH (N1), and definite NASH (N2) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2).
Associations between nutrient intake and NAFLD-associated clinical markers according to carbohydrate intake
Stratification of the study population into high carbohydrate (HC) and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups by carbohydrate intake and associations between nutrient intake and clinical markers in these groups. (a) Percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the HC and LC groups. (b) Absolute amounts of nutrient intake (in kcals) in each group, stratified by carbohydrate intake (%) and the NAFLD activity score (NAS). (c) The proportion of participants classified as obese population in each group (non-obese, BMI <25; obese, BMI ≥25 kg/m2), stratified by carbohydrate intake (%) and NAS. (d) Linear regression models (with 95% confidence interval bands highlighted in gray) between the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and carbohydrate intake (in kcals) with and without adjustment for BMI, age, and sex (HC, upper panel, red line; LC, lower panel, blue line). (e) Heatmap displaying the significant correlations between clinical markers and the intake of nutrients (*P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001). Positive correlations are expressed in red and negative correlations are in blue (HC, upper panel; LC, lower panel). (f) Linear regression models (with 95% confidence interval bands highlighted in gray) between clinical markers and the intake of carbohydrates (in kcals) after adjusting for BMI, age, and sex (HC, upper panel, red line; LC, lower panel, blue line).
On average, the HC group consumed 76.83% of daily total energy from carbohydrate, 11.28% from fat, and 11.89% from protein, while the LC group consumed 63.56% of daily total energy from carbohydrate, 20.16% from fat, and 16.28% from protein (Figure 1a). In terms of the absolute amount of each nutrient consumed, the LC group consumed higher amounts of fat, animal fat, plant fat, protein, animal protein, and plant protein than the HC group (Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 3). 
BMI did not significantly differ between the HC and LC groups (Table 1); The percentage of obese NASH individuals was higher in the LC group (N0 [43%], N1 [81%], and N2 [85%]) than the HC group (N0 [55%], N1 [72%], and N2 [71%]) (Figure 1c). In the LC group, body fat mass and visceral, subcutaneous, and total abdominal adipose tissue areas significantly increased with worsening the histological severity of NAFLD (Supplementary Figure 1).
Carbohydrate consumption was positively correlated with serum alanine transaminase (ALT), a liver damage marker only in the HC group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the positive correlation between carbohydrate intake and ALT in the HC group remained marginally significant (P = .053) (Figure 1d). Significant positive correlations between the surrogate markers of insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] and adipose tissue insulin resistance [adipo-IR]) with carbohydrate consumption were found only in the HC group. In contrast, obesity and lipid metabolism-associated clinical markers (low density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol and TG) were significantly correlated with carbohydrate consumption in the LC group (Figure 1e). These results were confirmed by a linear regression model adjusted for BMI, age, and sex. Carbohydrate intake significantly predicted FFA concentrations, HOMA-IR, adipo-IR, and insulin levels in the HC group, whereas carbohydrate intake significantly predicted LDL-cholesterol levels and BMI in the LC group (Figure 1f).
NAFLD activity-associated alterations in gut microbial diversity and composition in the HC group
Alterations in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome according to NAFLD severity in the high carbohydrate (HC) and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups. (a) Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot based on the Bray-Curtis distance showing the beta diversity of the gut microbiome composition at the genus level (HC: N0, yellow; N1, Orange; N2, red and LC: N0, light sky blue; N1, dark blue; N2, navy). (b) NMDS plot from (A) visualized as Tukey’s box and whisker plot, showing the median and upper and lower quantiles. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis. (c) Alpha diversity in each group (upper left, Simpson’s diversity index; upper right, Pielou’s evenness index; lower left, Shannon diversity index; lower right, species richness). (d) Relative abundances of the top 10 family taxa in the total, HC, and LC groups stratified by the NAFLD activity score.
In the HC group, the composition of gut microbiota varied significantly according to the NAS (P = .009), but this pattern was not exhibited in the LC group (P = .742) (Figure 2a). Subsequent analysis of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) scores showed a significant difference between the N1 and N2 groups (P = .0195) (Figure 2b). 
However, alpha diversity, measured using four indices (Simpson’s diversity index, Pielou’s evenness index, the Shannon diversity index, and species richness), did not significantly differ among the NAS subgroups in either the HC or LC group (Figure 2c). The top 10 microbial taxa enriched or depleted by NAFLD severity in all participants, the HC group, and the LC group were visualized using stacked bar plots (Figure 2d).
NAFLD activity-associated alterations in the relative abundances of gut microbial taxa in the HC group
Changes in the relative abundance of the gut microbial taxa according to NAFLD severity in the high carbohydrate (HC) and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups. (a) The abundance of three representative family taxa and (b) three representative genus taxa are depicted. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were used in the statistical analysis. (c) Ranking of the family taxa according to the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient in the random forest model to predict the NAFLD activity score. (red circle, top 3 families defined by the random forest model; blue pentagon, three representative family taxa) (d–f) Regression analysis was used to determine the abundance of the Ruminococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Veillonellaceae families after adjusting for confounding factors including BMI, age, and sex. Multivariate association analysis was performed using MaAsLin2 with adjustment for multiple comparisons. (d) Total: P = .0001, q = 0.034; P = .001, q = 0.140; P = .011, q = 0.419. (e) HC: P = .002, q = 0.035; P = .005, q = 0.202; P = .014, q = 0.341. (f) LC: P = .102, q = 0.71; P = .264, q = 0.84; P = .149, q = 0.026. (*P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001, †FDR<0.25).
Univariate analysis revealed a significant decrease in the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family (P = .006) and a significant increase in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae family (P = .010) with increasing NAFLD activity (N2 vs. N0) in the HC group, and a marginally significant increase in the abundance of Veillonellaceae in individuals with definite NASH (N2) compared to non-NASH individuals (N0) (P = .06). No significant alterations in the abundance of microbial taxa were found in the LC group (Figure 3a). These trends were maintained at the genus level in the HC group (Figure 3b): compared with subjects without NASH, NASH subjects had a significant decrease in the abundance of Faecalibacterium (N2 vs. N0), and a significant increase in the abundance of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae (N2 vs. N0) and Dialister (N1 vs. N0). 
The predictive validity of microbial taxa for NAFLD was tested using a random forest model (Figure 3c). The most critical microbial variables in the total population were the Veillonellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae families. The Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families were also crucial microbial variables in the HC group. Microbial variables selected for the prediction of NAFLD in the LC group were not significantly altered by NAFLD activity. Multivariate analysis was performed using MaAsLin2 after adjustment for BMI, age, and sex. Similar to the unadjusted data, in the HC group, the abundance of Ruminococcaceae was significantly depleted with increasing NAFLD activity, while the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly enriched (Figure 3d-f). Similar significant associations were not found in the LC group.
To analyze the functional changes in the gut microbiome in the HC and LC groups according to NAFLD severity, the functional prediction analysis was conducted. As a result of linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), a total of 287 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categories and 16 KEGG pathways were identified as significantly differing between the non-NASH (N0) and NASH (N1 and N2) subgroups within the HC group. On the other hand, no differences in the functional changes in KEGG categories between the non-NASH and NASH subgroups were observed, and 6 KEGG pathways were identified as significant in the LC group. The KEGG pathways found to be significant in the HC group are visualized in supplementary figure 2. Notably, the majority of KEGG pathways that were enriched in the NASH subgroup within the HC group were related to microbial carbohydrate metabolism, such as ‘phosphotransferase system PTS’, ‘glycerolipid metabolism’ and ‘fructose and mannose metabolism’.
Effect of carbohydrate intake on microbial diversity and composition in the non-NAFLD population
Alterations in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome according to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk in high carbohydrate (HC) and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups from the Health Twin cohort. A hepatic steatosis index (HSI) of 30 IU/L was used as the cutoff for determining NAFLD risk in the HC and LC groups (HC, n = 382; LC, n = 300). (a) NMDS plot showing the beta diversity of the gut microbiome composition in subjects with and without liver injury. NMDS scores were calculated using Bray-Curtis distance (HC group: HSI <30, pink; HSI ≥30, purple; LC group: HSI <30, yellow-green; HSI ≥30, dark green). (b) Alpha diversity was calculated using four indices (upper left, Simpson’s diversity index; upper right, the Shannon diversity; lower left, Pielou’s evenness index; lower right, species richness). (c) Relative abundances of the top 10 families are visualized in stacked bar plots for all patients as well as the HC and LC groups, stratified by liver injury severity. (d) Univariate analysis of three key microbial families using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests (*P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001).
To investigate the effect of an HC diet on the gut microbiome in the non-NAFLD population, gut microbiome data from the Korean healthy twin cohort were analyzed (n = 682) (Figure 4). Study subjects were divided into the HC and LC groups using a cutoff of 70% energy intake from carbohydrates (HC group, n = 382; LC group, n = 300) (Supplementary Figure 3A). Furthermore, both groups were subdivided into two subgroups according to the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) (HC group: HSI ≥30, n = 246; HSI <30, n = 135 and LC group: HSI ≥30, n = 211; HSI <30, n = 88). The population characteristics of the HC and LC groups in the healthy twin cohort are described in supplementary information (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figure 3). 
The composition and alpha diversity of the gut microbiome did not significantly differ by the HSI in the healthy twin cohort, regardless of carbohydrate intake (Figures 4 A and b). Among the three crucial microbial families (Ruminococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Veillonellaceae), the enrichment of the abundance of Veillonellaceae in individuals with high HSI was evident in all participants as well as in the HC and LC groups (Figure 4c). This observation was also confirmed in the HC group by univariate analysis (Figure 4d).
Differential regulation of DNL-related liver transcripts in the HC and LC groups
NAFLD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed to understand the genetic background of subjects (Supplementary Table 6). Of the five major SNPs (PNPLA3_rs738409 C > G, TM6SF2_rs58542926 C > T, SREBF2_rs133291 C > T, MBOAT7_rs641738 C > T, and HSD17B13_rs72613567 adenine insertion [A-INS]), only the prevalence of PNPLA3_rs738409 C > G significantly differed among the NAS subgroups in both the HC and LC groups. There were no significant differences in the minor allele frequency of PNPLA3_rs738409 between the HC and LC groups (P = .612), suggesting that the differences between the HC and LC groups were not attributable to genetic factors.
Changes in de novo lipogenesis (DNL)-related transcripts in the high carbohydrate (HC) intake group. (a) Heatmap displaying the correlation between DNL-related genes and the NAFLD activity score (NAS) in the HC and LC groups. Statistical analysis was performed using transformed z scores and Spearman’s rank correlation analysis. (b) Z score-transformed expression levels of predefined transcripts were compared between the HC and LC groups according to NAFLD severity using an one-way analyses of variance and the FDR correction for multiple comparisons. (c) Differentially expressed genes were defined using the R package DEseq2. The upper panel indicates log10 transformed P values and the lower panel indicates log2 transformed fold changes. (d) The linear regression model depicts the relationship between SREBF2 and Enterobacteriaceae after adjustment for BMI, age, and sex (*P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001).
Next, we analyzed liver transcripts related to hepatic DNL in the biopsy-proven NAFLD cohort (n = 90) (Figure 5). We investigated whether an HC diet was associated with upregulation of DNL due to increased glucose availability in the liver. A total of 37 DEseq2-normalized transcripts were selected and compared between the HC and LC groups according to NAFLD activity (Supplementary Table 7). We performed Spearman’s rank correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between the selected transcripts and the NAS in the HC and LC groups. In the HC group, G6PC and SIRT1 were negatively correlated with the NAS (P = .049 and P = .001), while HCFC1 and SREBF2 were positively correlated with the NAS (P = .016 and P = .041). In the LC group, USF1, NR1H3, and MLXIPL were inversely correlated with the NAS (P = .021, P = .008, and P = .037), whereas SCD and mTOR were positively correlated with the NAS (P = .009 and P = .017) (Figure 5a). 
Significant correlations were confirmed by comparing z score-transformed expression levels of the corresponding genes (Figure 5b). In the HC group, HCFC1 expression was higher and SIRT1 expression was lower in N2 subjects than in N0 subjects (P = .018 and P = .001, respectively). Although differences in the expression of SREBF2 and G6PC did not reach statistical significance, higher SREBF2 expression and lower G6PC expression were observed with increasing NAFLD activity (N2 vs. N0; P = .057 and P = .072, respectively). The expression of USF1, NR1H3, and MLXIPL was lower (P = .022, P = .009, and P = .045, respectively) and the expression of SCD and mTOR was higher with increasing NAFLD activity in the LC group (SCD, P = .009 [N2 vs. N0]; mTOR, P = .035 [N0 vs. N1]; and P = .022 [N0 vs. N2]). Among the corresponding transcripts in the HC group, SREBF2, SIRT1 and HCFC1 significantly differed between the HC and LC groups in the definite NASH subgroup (N2) (Supplementary Figure 4).
We identified differentially expressed genes between the N0 vs. N1+ N2 subgroups (Figure 5c). Specifically, SIRT1, FASN, SREBF2, and HCFC1 were differentially expressed in the HC group (P = .002, P = .014, P = .029, and P = .042, respectively) and the expression of mTOR, SCD, GSK3B, and MLXIPL were differentially expressed in the LC group (P = .005, P = .012, P = .017, and P = .026, respectively). Among the analyzed transcripts, we focused on the association between SREBF2 and the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 5d, Supplementary Figure 5). A linear regression model adjusted for BMI, age, and sex revealed that the expression of SREBF2 was predictive of Enterobacteriaceae abundance in the HC group (P = .006). This suggests a close relationship between NAFLD activity, DNL, and the gut microbiome community under HC diet conditions.
Prediction of NASH using three gut microbial families in the HC group
Noninvasive multidimensional prediction of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) using three microbial families and potential clinical variables in all subjects as well as the high carbohydrate (HC), and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups (non-NASH vs. NASH). The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed for detecting NASH among study subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Area under receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUROC) analyses including clinical variables (BMI, age, and sex) (blue) vs. those also including the three microbial families (Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae) in addition to clinical variables (BMI, age, and sex) (red) plotted for the diagnosis of NASH in (a)all subjects as well as, (b) the HC, and (c) LC groups. P values were calculated using the DeLong test.
We performed the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis to evaluate whether specific gut microbial families predict the presence of NASH among subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Three microbial families, Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae, which were present in differing amounts according to NAFLD activity in the HC group, were incorporated into the prediction model (Figure 6). For NASH diagnosis, the addition of these microbial families to the prediction model including BMI, age, and sex yielded an AUC of 0.861 in the HC group (95% CI, 0.774–0.940), which was significantly higher than that of the prediction model including only BMI, age, and sex (AUC = 0.743; 95% CI, 0.625–0.860; P = .018 by DeLong test) (Figure 6b). However, the addition of those microbial families did not significantly improve the predictive validity of the model for detecting NASH in the LC group (AUC = 0.874 [microbes-BMI-age-sex]; AUC = 0.872 [BMI-age-sex]; 95% CI, 0.735–0.937; P = .883 by DeLong test) (Figure 6c). 
Causal effects of clinical markers, gut microbes, and gene expression on NAFLD pathogenesis
The causal relationships among nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related microbes, transcripts, and clinical factors in the high carbohydrate (HC) and low carbohydrate (LC) intake groups. Causal inference of inverse, normally transformed microbiome families (Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae), transcripts (SREBF2, SIRT1, and mTOR), and clinical variables (ALT, AST, adipo-IR, HOMA-IR, insulin, FFA, and BMI) were calculated using kernel causality analysis; significant causal correlations were visualized using Cytoscape. Causality of variables in the (a) HC and (b) LC groups. Solid line indicates a positive correlation and the dashed lines indicates a negative correlation. The thickness of the line indicates the degree of statistical significance (thin: less significant P values; thick: more-significant P values).
To determine causality among several variables, we used kernel causality analysis, which identifies plausible causal pathways between two variables using generalized correlation coefficients(Figure 7). The descriptive source data are shown in Supplementary Table 8. Differences in the causality of variables between the HC and LC groups were observed. In the HC group, we identified positive causation between insulin resistance-related markers, such as HOMA-IR and adipo-IR, and liver damage markers, such as ALT, aspartate transaminase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Additionally, there was positive causation between the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and a DNL regulator, SREBF2; both Enterobacteriaceae and SREBF2 were involved in reducing SIRT1, a lipid biosynthesis suppressor gene.
