Participant characteristics
  Figure 1  describes study recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 178 eligible participants, 163 were randomly assigned and 157 provided baseline fecal samples that were included in the intent-to-treat fecal microbiota and metabolite analyses. Study outcomes were also analyzed for the 109 per-protocol participants at the 12-wk follow-up time point who provided fecal samples at both baseline and endline. Diet records were analyzed for 106 per-protocol participants who provided ≥5 d of information. Dietary record data revealed that baseline avocado intake was low (0.10 ± 0.01 servings/d) and less than half of participants reported any avocado consumption at baseline. Control participants reported consuming 0.04  servings/d of avocado at 12 wk, which was not different from baseline. Conversely, the avocado treatment group reported consuming significantly more avocado at the 12-wk timepoint (2.3  servings/d; P < 0.001). Self-reported study meal intake was 90% ± 1% during the 12-wk intervention and most participants (n = 133, 82%) reported meal consumption of ≥80%. Participants (Table 2) were predominantly female (64%) and of Caucasian descent (77%). Forty-three percent of participants had overweight and 57% had obesity. Female participants presented with significantly larger BMI values (P = 0.02), and 68% of this group presented with obesity. Male participants were predominantly (61%) in the overweight BMI category.

Per-protocol results
Dietary intake and body weight at 12-wk follow-up
As intended, participants in the avocado group reported MUFA consumption that was ∼20 g greater than the control group and 14 g of additional dietary fiber. Self-reported total energy intake tended to be 300 kcal/d higher in the avocado compared with the control group (P = 0.07) (Table 3). Interestingly, dietary record results revealed similar saturated and polyunsaturated fat intake between the 2 groups, despite the differences in these fatty acids between the control and intervention meals. Body weight did not differ between groups at 12-wk follow-up (control group, 96.0 ± 2.68 kg; avocado group, 96.2 ± 2.76 kg; P = 0.95).

Fecal microbiota and metabolites
Faith Phylogenetic Diversity, a measure of microbiota α-diversity, was greater among the avocado group (P = 0.02) (Figure 2). The weighted Unifrac distances, a measure of β-diversity, tended to be greater in the avocado group compared with the control group at the 12-wk follow-up visit (P = 0.09) (Supplemental Figure 1). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, and Alistipes were enriched in the avocado group, while the relative abundances of Roseburia and Ruminococcus were diminished (Table 4). Fecal acetate (P = 0.01) concentrations were greater in the avocado group as compared with the control group at the end of the intervention period (Table 5). Additionally, concentrations of cholic acid (P = 0.01) were greater and chenodeoxycholic acid tended to be higher (P = 0.07) in the control group (Figure 3; Supplemental Table 1), whereas concentrations of a variety of SFAs and MUFAs were greater in the avocado group (Figure 4; Supplemental Table 2).

Associations between fecal bacteria, metabolites, and metabolic outcomes
Correlational analyses were conducted within the avocado group among bacteria that differed by group at the end of the intervention and fecal metabolites and metabolic health outcomes. Inverse relations were observed between Lachnospira and fecal cholic acid concentrations (r = −0.32, P = 0.05, n = 40), insulin AUC (r = −0.36, P = 0.02, n = 45), and TNF- concentrations (r = −0.32, P = 0.02, n = 50) in the avocado group (Supplemental Methods; Table 6). Alistipes was also negatively related to fecal cholic acid concentrations (r = −0.35, P = 0.03, n = 40) in the avocado group.

Intent-to-treat analyses
Dietary intake and body weight at 12-wk follow-up
As intended, participants in the avocado group reported greater intake of MUFAs, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, soluble dietary fiber, and pectin. Saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, total carbohydrate, and total protein intakes were similar between groups (Supplemental Table 3). Between-group body weight was similar at 12-wk follow-up (control group, 94.7 ± 2.21 kg; avocado group, 95.5 ± 2.37 kg; P = 0.80).
Fecal microbiota and metabolites
Weighted Unifrac distances, a measure of microbiota β-diversity, tended to be different between groups (P = 0.053) (Supplemental Figure 2). Faith Phylogenetic Diversity, a measure of α-diversity, did not differ between groups (P = 0.13). The relative abundances of Alistipes (P = 0.003) and Ruminococcus (P = 0.01) were greater and Faecalibacterium (P = 0.07) and Lachnospira tended to be enriched (P = 0.06) at the end of the 12-wk intervention period in the avocado group (Supplemental Table 4). Lachnobacterium (P = 0.08) tended to be greater in the control group.
Fecal acetate concentrations (P = 0.02) were greater in the avocado group when compared with the control group (Supplemental Figure 3). Differences in fecal bile acid concentrations (Supplemental Figure 4, Supplemental Table 5) were also evident, including greater fecal cholic acid concentrations (P = 0.01) in the control group. The control group tended to have greater fecal deoxycholic acid (P = 0.08), lithocholic acid (P = 0.09), summed primary bile acid concentrations (P = 0.07), and total bile acid concentrations (P = 0.07).
