A total of 35 (10 males, 25 females) subjects completed the GOS intervention, 34 subjects completed FOS intervention for one women dropped out in FOS period (Fig. 1). Anthropometric and physiological data for the volunteers at the start of prebiotic intervention were shown in Table 1. There were no difference between FOS and GOS groups at the beginning of the study. Compliance and Minor side effect were reported at the end of each intervention according to the questionnaire of gastrointestinal symptoms in Supplementary Table S1. These symptoms disappeared within a few days in most participants.  
Changes of anthropometric and glucose metabolism after FOS and GOS intervention
Comparison of the glucose profiles with OGTT of subjects in (A) and (C) FOS Day0 and FOS Day14; (B) and (D) GOS Day0 and GOS Day14. Comparison of the butyric acid in feces. (E) FOS Day0 and Day 14; (F)GOS Day0 and Day 14. Data are means ± SD (*p < 0.05; Paired t tests).
After 14-day intervention, neither FOS or GOS had significant impact on body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), Body Fat, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Visceral Fat Index, Skeletal Muscle and calorie intake. Similarly, the changes of blood glucose are still within the normal range (Table 1). Whereas, the glucose response significantly increased in 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min after ingesting 75 g glucose in FOS group (P < 0.001, Fig. 2A). In terms of OGTT, the increased area under blood glucose concentration curve was also identified in FOS intervention (P < 0.001, Fig. 2C), not in GOS intervention (P = 0.159, Fig. 2D). Moreover, fasting glucose was slightly increased with statistical significance after 14 days of GOS intervention (P < 0.05, Fig. 2B). 
Changes of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) after FOS and GOS intervention
Content (ug/mg) of fecal SCFAs at Day0 and Day14 with FOS and GOS intervention1.

1 Values are mean ± SD. *Significantly from baseline, P < 0.05 (Paired-Samples T Test).
The fecal concentration of SCFAs, including acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid and isovaleric acid, were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrum (GC-MS). The results showed that FOS significantly reduced the fecal concentration of butyric acid (P < 0.05, Fig. 2E, Table 2). A reduced tendency of butyric acid was identified in GOS intervention (P = 0.097, Fig. 2F). In addition, the concentration of acetic acid and total SCFAs were decreased after FOS and GOS intervention, but without statistical differences. 
Composition of gut microbiota was profoundly altered after FOS and GOS intervention
(A–D) Comparison of α-diversity between the gut microbiota of FOS Day0 and FOS Day14, GOS Day0 and GOS Day14. Four indices were used to represent the α-diversity which is (A) Chao1, (B) observed species, (C) Shannon index, and (D) PD whole tree. PD indicates phylogenetic diversity. Data are mean ± 95% CI. (*P < 0.05; Paired t tests); (E,F) Principal coordinate analysis based on the unweighted UniFrac distances. (E) FOS intervention, (F) GOS intervention. The red dots represent samples (intestinal microbiota) of pre-intervention, and the blue dots represent samples of post-intervention.
In terms of α-diversity, including species richness (represented by Chao1, observed species), phylogenetic diversity (represented by phylogenetic diversity whole tree) and richness and evenness (represented by Shannon index) of the microbial community, showed that after GOS intervention, the α-diversity was significantly lower than that before intervention. Phylogenetic diversity whole tree, Shannon index and observed species all reached statistical significance using the Wilcoxon rank sun test within GOS group (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A–D). In addition, the PCoA (a dimensionality reduction method illustrating the relationship between samples based on distance matrix) with unweighted unifrac distance indicated there was trend of separation of GOS intervention by gut microbiota (Fig. 3F, P < 0.05). PCoA visualizes the unsupervised grouping pattern of a complex data set like microbiome, and clear separation in PCoA by coloring samples from metadata indicates that the chosen information is related to microbiome. Analyses suggested that the GOS intervention was related to a significantly modification of gut microbiome, Whereas FOS intervention had no effect on α-diversity and no separation in PCoA (Fig. 3E). Moreover, after a 28-day washout period, the gut microbiota recovered to its pre-intervention state (Fig. S1). 
Taxonomic summary of the gut microbiota of FOS Day0 and FOS Day14, GOS Day0 and GOS Day14 at (A) phylum level and (B) genus level. Significantly discriminative taxa between (C) FOS Day0 and FOS Day14, (D) GOS Day0 and GOS Day14 determined using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LDA effect size). The red bar chart represents the bacteria that was more abundant in patients’ fecal samples, and the blue bar chart represents the controls.
Most of the gut bacteria detected in FOS and GOS group fall into 3 phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Fig. 4A). The genus-level microbial characterization was more complex, 20 genera (mainly Bacteroides, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Megasphaera and Bifidobacterium) constituted up to 80% of gut microbiota (Fig. 4B). LEfSe analysis showed a clear difference after FOS intervention, with increased level of Bifidobacterium and reduced abundance of Phascolarctobacterium, Enterobacter, Turicibacter, Coprococcus and Salmonella (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the level of Bifidobacterium was increased and the level of Ruminococcus, Dehalobacterium, Synergistes and Holdemania was decreased after GOS intervention (Fig. 4D). 
High interpersonal variability in FOS and GOS intervention and the prediction of personalized glucose metabolism responses
Variability of OGTT in two prebiotics intervention (A). Red dots represent OGTT elevated after both prebiotics. Green dots represent OGTT reduced after both prebiotics. Yellow dots represent OGTT reduced after FOS intervention, but elevated after GOS intervention; Blue dots represent OGTT reduced after GOS intervention, but elevated after FOS intervention; Glucose profiles changing with prebiotics intervention in Participants 104 and (B) Participants 204; (C) System clustering of microbiota composition at genus level. The names of several of the most abundant genera that included shown in the heatmap are listed on the right of the figure. The groups are listed at the top of the heatmap. FOS Day0, FOS Day14, GOS Day0 and GOS Day14 represent different prebiotic period. Different color represents samples from different subjects. And the color bar at the right of the heatmap shows the relative abundance of the sequences in each fecal sample.
When comparing the results of OGTT, we found high interpersonal variability (Fig. 5A). The OGTT of nine subjects was elevated after FOS, but reduced after GOS (Blue dots in Fig. 5A). Whereas, six subjects had the opposite situation. Their OGTT was reduced after FOS, but elevated after GOS (Yellow dots in Fig. 5A); For example, the glucose response of NO.104 became worse after FOS intervention but improved after GOS intervention (Fig. 5B). Whereas, in NO.204, the glucose response was improved by FOS intervention, but deteriorated by GOS intervention (Fig. 5C). In terms of gut microbiota, the increase of Bifidobacterium was detected in all participants except NO.118, NO.204 and NO.216. Nonetheless, other bacteria varied highly with different prebiotic intervention. Highly abundant gut microbiota and their temporal dynamics in each subject during different prebiotic intervention were demonstrated in Fig. 5D. The system clustering was formed to obtain a visual representation of the overall dynamic and each participant exhibited different microbial community. 
Since significant individual differences were detected, we further used machine learning with a random forest model to test whether metadata, such as BMI, the type of prebiotics and the initial OGTT, in addition to fecal microbial taxa could predict the OGTT outcomes following the prebiotic intervention. Firstly, we developed a random forest model with the whole 16 S microbiome data, as the OGTT of each participant were predicted by tenfold cross-validation approach. By using the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm, 40 OTUs were selected to build the optimal model. The OTUs in the model belonged to four phylum, Bacteroidetes (18/40), Firmicutes (20/40), Actinobacteria (1/40) and Proteobacteria (1/40).
Accurate predictions of personalized OGTT responses after prebiotics intervention. (A–C) OGTT predictions. Dots represent predicted (x axis) and measured OGTT (y axis) after prebiotic intervention, for a model based: (A) only on the initial OGTT (B) on the initial OGTT and microbiome; (C) only on the microbiome. (D) Unique bacterial taxa and host factor identified in OGTT with the model. The box size to the prediction OGTT indicate the importance of the factor attributed to the OGTT outcomes. The names of the important bacterial taxa are listed on the left of the figure; the important host factors are listed on the right of the figure.
And then we only used physiological data, including the initial OGTT, BMI, body fat, BMR, visceral fat index, skeletal muscle, to build a baseline model to predict the OGTT outcomes after prebiotic intervention. The correlation coefficient between the measured OGTT values and the predicted OGTT values was statistically significant (R = 0.595, P < 10−5, Fig. 6A). In addition, the features that integrate the above metadata and the 40 selected OTUs predicts the following OGTT after intervention had a significantly higher correlation coefficient (R = 0.739, P < 10−10, Fig. 6B). The increased correlation for the model added with microbiota indicated that the initial fecal bacterial community correlated better with the OGTT outcomes than these known risk factors of glucose intolerance. Of interest, only using the microbial taxa (40 selected OTUs), the correlation coefficient between the measured OGTT values and the predicted OGTT values was still higher than that only using physiological data (R = 0.726, P < 10−10, Fig. 6C). 
According to the model results, further exploration indicated that the initial OGTT, fasting glucose, and BMI were the host factors correlated with the predicted OGTT (Fig. 6D). We further picked the bacterial lineages of importance for modeling and observed that the initial microbiome had a better explanation for the prediction model than the physiological parameters. The results demonstrated that Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Veilllonellaceae, Phascolarctobacterium and Bifidobacterium were all correlated with the OGTT outcomes. It was noticed that the genera Bacteroides contributed most to the prediction model. Meanwhile, some universal butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Phascolarctobacterium, also correlated with OGTT outcomes in the prediction model. Whereas, Clostridium, which was identified as highly discriminant for T2DM, were also correlated with the OGTT outcomes. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the initial gut microbiome had the potential to predict OGTT outcomes after different types of prebiotic intervention.
