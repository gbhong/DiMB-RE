Data are expressed as mean ± SD. BMI: body mass index; TG: triglyceride; TC: total cholesterol, HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; hs-CRP: high sensitivity C reactive protein; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin.
Forty-five subjects with cardiometabolic risk profile were included and randomized: 39 completed the cross-over study (17 men, 22 women) and were analyzed (Figure 1). Ninety-two percent were dyslipidemic (high triglycerides (TG) and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and/or high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or high total cholesterol (TC). They had neither fasting hyperglycemia nor diabetes nor elevated hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) nor hypertension (Table 1).  
Participants dietary intake and compliance
The mean compliance to the dietary interventions (control (CTL) and multi-fiber (MF) bread consumption) was high (99%). Dietary records showed that subjects did not modify their energy and macronutrient intakes throughout the study. Likewise, the daily dietary fiber intake (without including consumed bread) in quantity and diversity remained low (<20 g/day, <3 fiber-rich food group/day) and was not modified throughout the study (Table S1). Consumed fiber-rich food items were mainly from starchy food, vegetables, and fruits (Figure S1).
Impact of dietary interventions on gut microbiota composition
Only the multi-fiber bread significantly modified gut microbiota composition
Abundance of the MSP significantly impacted by multi-fiber bread (n=39).
The two-month consumption of MF bread altered gut microbiota composition by modifying the relative abundance of specific gut bacterial species. Bacteroides vulgatus msp_0069 significantly decreased (cliff’s delta (CD), effect size: −0.27, small), whereas Parabacteroides distasonis msp_0012 (CD: 0.72, large), Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans msp_0154 (CD: 0.49, large), the unclassified Acutalibacteraceae msp_0291 (CD: 0.47, medium), and the unclassified Eisenbergiella msp_0125 (CD: 0.46, medium) significantly increased (q ≤ 0.1) (Figure 2). CTL bread did not significantly alter gut microbiota composition. Consistently, when assessing intra-individual changes, of species relative abundance, based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index before and after each bread consumption, we observed that compared to control bread, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index of gut microbiota was larger with multi-fiber bread consumption 0.38 ± 0.08 vs 0.34 ± 0.10 (p = .02) (Figure S2).
The washout period was appropriate. When assessing intra-individuals Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index between the different visits in the group that consumed MF bread and the group that consumed CTL bread during the period 1, we actually showed that there was no difference concerning the dissimilarity between V2 and V5 in the two groups (p = .75) although the dissimilarity between V2 – V4 was different (p = .06). Moreover, the species, which were increased or decreased in abundance with the multi-fiber bread showed no significant difference between V2 (baseline) and V5 (after wash-out) (Figure S3).
Gut microbiota richness throughout the interventions (n=39).
Gut microbiota function (n=39)
All along the dietary intervention, microbiota richness in terms of gene count and MSP (Metagenomic Species) count did not significantly differ (CD: 0.07 and 0.04 negligible respectively) (Figure 3).
Impact of dietary interventions on gut microbiota functions
Only the multi-fiber bread significantly modified gut microbiota functions
The bioconversion potential of dietary fibers according to the microbial CAZymes patterns was assessed as the fraction of gut microbiota carrying a given CAZyme, i.e. the sum of species (MSP) with at least one gene annotated with this CAZyme (see Methods). Out of the 200 examined CAZyme families, MF bread impacted the relative abundance of CAZymes from eight different families and sub-families, among which six were significantly increased and two significantly decreased (absolute CD ranging from 0.23, small to 0.58, large, q < 0.1), while remaining stable with control bread (Figure 4). The increased CAZymes belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families (GH30_2, GH43_8, GH43_28, GH43_33, and GH76) and glycosyl-transferase (GT) family (GT17), while the decreased CAZymes belong to polysaccharide lyase (PL) family (PL26) and GH13_29 subfamily. Among the increased putative GHs, two GH30_2 proteins shared 51% and 52% aminoacid (aa) identity with a characterized β-D-xylosidase from rumen bacterium (ADO20355), respectively. One putative GH43_8 protein has 37% aa identity with a β-D-galactofuranosidase from Bacteroides salyersiae (EIY66405) and a GH43_33 sequence shared 39% aa identity with an α-L-arabinofuranosidase from Halothermothrix orenii H168 (ACL70803). Two GH76 putative proteins presented 31% and 38% aa identity with an endo-α-1,6-mannanase from Bacillus circulans (BAA75632), respectively. No characterized protein sequence was yet available for similarity search to the GH43_28 subfamily. Consistently, all the five increased putative GH families were found in P. distasonis msp_0012, two of them were also found in F. saccharivorans msp_0154 (GH43_28) and in the unclassified Eisenbergiella msp_0215 (GH76), respectively. Furthermore, the protein sequences of GH30_2, GH43_8, GH43_28, GH43_33, and GH76 were identical to those of several strains of P. distasonis already annotated for CAZymes (http://www.cazy.org/bP.html). Homologous proteins were also found in numerous P. distasonis sequences available in the databases (not shown).
Regarding gut-metabolic modules (GMM), only the cysteine pathway of methionine degradation (methionine = > L-homocysteine) changed significantly during the intervention and was increased with MF bread consumption (CD: 0.32, small; p = .026) (Figure 4). Interestingly, the mercaptan pathway of methionine degradation (methionine = > methanethiol) showed the opposite evolution with similar effect size, non-significantly after multiple test, though (p = .04, q = 1). Short-chain fatty acids-related GMM were not modulated during the intervention.

Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Effects of multi-fiber bread were analyzed using linear mixed model for repeated measures with heterogeneous Toeplitz or autoregressive as covariance structure. MF: multi-fiber bread; CTL: control bread; BMI: body mass index; RMR: resting metabolic rate; HOMA IR: homeostasic model assessment of insulin resistance; TC: total cholesterol; HDL cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG: triglyceride; NEFA: non-esterified fatty acid; hs-CRP: high sensitivity C-reactive protein. EGD: estimated group difference. Adjusted p value *< 0.05 ** <0.01.
Compared to CTL bread, MF bread significantly decreased total cholesterol (TC: −0.42 mM), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C:-0.36 mM), insulin (−2.77 mUI/l) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA: −0.78) (q < 0.05) (Figure 5). There was no significant impact of MF bread on anthropometric and inflammatory parameters as well as on the postprandial metabolism of glucose in response to a standardized test meal challenge (Table 2). 
Association between gut microbiota composition and function, and metabolic parameters
Correlation between metagenomic features and clinical variables (n=39).
We correlated the delta (after – before multi-fiber bread consumption) of impacted metagenomics features with those of clinical variables related to cholesterol and glucose metabolisms (Figure 6). We showed that a group of features enriched after multi-fiber bread consumption, P. distasonis, an unclassified Eisenbergiella, methionine degradation, and a set of GHs (GH30_2, GH43_8, GH43_28, GH43_33, GH76) were negatively correlated with the peaks and total/incremental area under curve (tAUC/iAUC) of postprandial glycemia and insulin, in response to a standardized test meal challenge.
