Mean ± standard deviation; WG whole grain, FV fruits and vegetables, BMI body mass index, IL-6 interleukin-6, TNF tumor necrosis factor-α, hs-CRP high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, LBP lipopolysaccharide binding protein, SCFA short chain fatty acids, BCFA branched chain fatty acids
There were no significant differences among treatment groups at baseline except for age (Table 1). Participants in the WG group were significantly older than the control group. This was due to a higher proportion of subjects that were over 40 years of age (52% compared with 11% in the FV group and 0% in the control group). We are uncertain as to the cause of this significant difference as subjects were randomized into treatment groups. It is known that composition and activity of the microbiome changes as one ages. There were two elderly subjects (> 70 years of age) in the study: one in the WG group and the other in the FV group.
There were a few notable non-significant observations in the baseline data concerning the microbiota (Table 1). First, the fecal butyrate concentration seemed unusually high in the control group. While not significant, it was concerning to observe these high values at baseline. The reasons for the apparently high butyrate concentration in the control group is not known. Second, we observed that the Bacteroidetes phylum appeared underrepresented and the Firmicutes phylum overrepresented in this sample population compared with several studies, although this may not be a relevant issue. The low abundance of Bacteroidetes could be due to the characteristics of the type of subjects recruited for this study. It could also be due to bias during fecal DNA extraction. Importantly, DNA was extracted and sequencing was performed on baseline and end of study fecal samples simultaneously. Therefore, any bias created during the analysis would likely affect all samples uniformly.

Mean ± standard deviation; means followed by different letters in the same column are significantly different (p < 0.05)
Based on diet diaries, participants in the WG and FV groups were compliant with the treatment protocols (Table 2). The diaries also showed that the interventions were treatment specific; e.g., subjects in the FV group did not increase consumption of WG foods while subjects in the WG group avoided FV. Based on intake of refined grain in the control group it appeared that the subjects in the WG group replaced refined grain foods with WG foods. Oddly, despite repeated instructions, it appeared that the subjects in the FV group may not have recorded all refined grain foods consumed. Perhaps they were more concerned about making sure to record all treatment foods.
Weekly gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded to track changes throughout the study. There were no significant changes in GI symptoms throughout the study, indicating that the treatments were well-tolerated (see Additional file 2).
BMI was recorded at baseline and at the end of the study. There were no significant changes in BMI (see Additional file 3).
Changes in inflammatory markers during the treatment period. a) Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP); b) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; c) interleukin (IL)-6; and d) high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 for change across time = 0; all analyses corrected for baseline concentrations, age, gender, and body mass index; one subject was excluded from the control group in the IL-6 analysis due to an outlying value (15.7 pg/mL)
There were significant decreases in LBP from baseline values in participants consuming the WG and FV diets with no change for those on the control diet (Fig. 2). Additionally, the WG diet resulted in a significant decrease in TNF-α levels during the intervention, whereas no significant changes in TNF-α were found for those on the other treatment. There were no significant changes in circulating IL-6 levels for subjects receiving the control and WG treatments for IL-6, but there was a significant decrease in FV diet. There were no significant changes from baseline for hs-CRP levels for any subjects.
Changes in microbiota characteristics
There were no significant changes in fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production during the study period for any participants (see Additional file 3). The apparently high fecal butyrate in the control group at baseline appeared to remain high for the duration of the study such that no significant change over time was observed.
Changes in fecal microbiota during the treatment period. a) α-Diversity; b) β-diversity; and c) operational taxonomic unit (OTU) fold-change; * p < 0.05, for change across time = 0; diversity measures corrected for baseline concentrations, age, gender, and body mass index
Change in dominant bacteria in fecal samples from baseline to the end of the treatment. Treatment groups are clustered using hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method); taxa are ordered by absolute change in abundance across all subjects; uncl, unclassified; C, control; FV, fruits and vegetables; WG, whole grain
The FV intervention resulted in a significant increase in α-diversity, a measure of species richness, while the other treatment groups did not show any effect (Fig. 3). β-Diversity, a measure of the change in species richness over time, was not significantly different across treatment groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences between treatment groups from baseline to the end of treatment at the OTU level. When OTUs were binned according to their relative fold change during the intervention, the WG and FV treatment groups showed a shift toward a decrease in some OTUs of < 0.5-fold while the control treatment group showed a shift toward an increase of < 0.5 fold. No significant change in bacterial genera were found, but there were observable individualized responses to the treatments (Fig. 4). Based on the cluster analysis, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus (Ruminococcaceae), Ruminococcus (Lachnospiraceae), Bifidobacterium, and Fecalibacterium showed the most change from baseline to the end of the study, but changes were not dependent on treatment groups.
Association between changes in inflammatory markers and microbiota composition
Correlations between change in plasma markers during the study and microbiota composition. a) Baseline abundance; b) end of study abundance; and c) log2 fold-change during the study of stool microbiota; d) scatterplot of baseline abundance of Firmicutes and change in lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) during the study; LBP lipopolysaccharide binding protein, TNF-α tumor necrosis factor, IL-6 interleukin-6, hs-CRP high sensitivity C-reactive protein, WG whole grain, FV fruits and vegetables; partial variables were treatment group, age, gender, and body mass index; N = 49 except IL-6 where N = 48; p-values were corrected for false discovery rate; * adjusted p < 0.05
Changes in inflammatory makers during the study appeared to be more correlated with baseline microbiota composition than with changes in microbiota composition during the study or composition at the end of the study (Fig. 5). Significant correlations were found between baseline microbiota composition and change in LBP during the study. In particular, individuals with higher Firmicutes and lower Bacteroidetes showed a greater decrease in LBP during the study. At deeper taxonomic levels, it appeared that this was due mostly to abundance of a few genera of the Clostridales order (see Additional file 4).
