Iron status
Figure 1 is the flow chart of subject recruitment. Forty-four subjects consented and 37 completed the study between April 2011 and December 2013: 22 were in the iron + placebo group (Fe group) and 15 were in the iron + vitamin E group (Fe + E group). Follow-up contact was lost for 5 participants and an additional 2 dropped out (one did not accept taste of the iron supplement; one moved out of state). There were no serious adverse events reported. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. No differences in age, iron status or inflammation status were observed between groups at baseline and all participants were iron deficient with a serum ferritin level of 11 ± 3 ug/L. Dietary intakes of iron, calcium, vitamin E or phytic acid were comparable between groups at baseline and post intervention (Supplementary table 1).
Overall, over 80% subjects from the iron + placebo (87%) and iron +vitamin E (83%) groups consumed more than 80% of the supplements. After 8 weeks of iron supplementation, average serum ferritin level returned to normal without differences between groups (Table 1). Two subjects from the Fe group remained iron deficient after the treatment (serum ferritin at 9.5 and 9.1 ug/L at the end), despite good reported compliance in consuming the supplement. Iron binding capacity and soluble transferrin receptor concentration significantly decreased over time (Table 1). A significant group-by-time interaction was observed for iron saturation, which increased in Fe + E only (Table 1).
Inflammation markers
Serum vitamin E-alpha concentration at baseline was comparable between groups: 9.8 ± 2.6 and 10.6 ± 2.8 ug/ml for the Fe and Fe + E groups, respectively. As expected, vitamin E-alpha concentration did not change in the Fe group (Δ -0.29 ± 2.77 ug/ml), and increased in the Fe + E group (Δ 1.31 ± 6.08 ug/ml, group-by-time interaction P < 0.01). There were no adverse events reported or safety concerns raised by parents regarding vitamin E intake. Fecal calprotectin concentration was comparable between groups at baseline (Fe group: 49 ± 44 ug/g; Fe + E: 50 ± 58 ug/g). After intervention, calprotectin concentrations were 53 ± 44 and 46 ± 58 ug/g for Fe and Fe + E groups, respectively, which represented a borderline significant group-by-time interaction (P = 0.1). Serum IL-4 concentration did not change over time in the Fe group (0.025 ± 0.015 to 0.025 ± 0.016 pg/ml) or Fe + E group (0.025 ± 0.013 to 0.026 ± 0.013 pg/ml). A similar pattern was observed for serum TNF-α concentration over time in the Fe group (13.2 ± 4.9 to 13.0 ± 4.8 pg/ml) and Fe + E group (14.2 ± 3.3 to 12.0 ± 4.0 pg/ml).
Gut microbiome
Pairs of stool samples collected at baseline and study completion were available from 32 subjects (Fe n=18; Fe + E n=14), all of which were successfully profiled for bacterial diversity using broad-range 16S rRNA sequencing. Good's coverage indices exceeded 99% for all samples, indicating that each sequence dataset adequately represented the biodiversity in the sample from which it was derived. Microbial alpha-diversity increased over time with no difference between groups (data not shown). Changes in the microbiome between treatment groups and time-points were assessed at the phylum, family and genus levels.
The Fe and Fe + E groups exhibited significantly different changes in microbiome composition over time. These differences were most evident in the highly abundant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Figure 2). With vitamin E added to iron supplementation, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased by 10% while the Firmicutes increased by 11% on average. These phylum-level effects were driven primarily by changes in the families Bacteroidaceae (phylum Bacteroidetes), which decreased in abundance, and Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes) which increased in abundance in the Fe +E group, relative to the Fe group. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Roseburia, a butyrate producing member of the phylum Firmicutes, increased in the Fe + E group (Δ 1.3%, P < 0.01). Finally the genus Escherichia, which includes both commensal and pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli as well as pathogenic Shigella spp., decreased by 1.2% on average among all participants (Figure 3, effect of time P = 0.01).
