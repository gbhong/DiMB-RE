3.1. Body Weight and Food Intake
Aged animals fed the SDP feed showed a higher rate of body weight gain than control (CTL) mice (p < 0.001; Figure 1A). At the end of the experimental period, body weight gain was greater in SDP mice than in CTL mice (p = 0.008; Figure 1B). Both groups of animals had similar food intake (Figure 1C).
3.2. Behavioral and Cognitive Tests
AD is associated with behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, so we evaluated whether SDP could mitigate these alterations in aged SAMP8 mice. Representative tracking maps of the OFT of all groups are shown in Figure 1A. Aging reduced the locomotor activity of the mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p < 0.001; Figure 2B) and SDP attenuated this reduction (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.027). Furthermore, we showed reduced exploratory activity (6M-CTL and 6M-SDP, p < 0.001 and p = 0.008; Figure 2C), and increased anxiety-like behavior (6M-CTL and 6M-SDP, p = 0.019 and p < 0.001; Figure 2D) in both groups of aged mice, without differences due to SDP supplementation.
To assess the working memory of mice, they were evaluated using the NORT. During the familiarization phase, all groups had a similar explorative index and object preference (Figure 3A,B, respectively). Regarding short-term memory, aged mice had lower values of DI than younger mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.008; Figure 3C). SDP supplementation prevented this reduction (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.039), showing similar DI values to those of young mice. Regarding long-term memory, aged mice had a lower DI than the young group (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p < 0.001; Figure 3D). SDP supplementation prevented this reduction, as these mice showed higher DI values than aged mice (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.040).
3.3. Effects on the CNS
Molecularly, it has been well-established that SAMP8 presents changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. Neither aging nor SDP supplementation changed the relative abundance of the precursor form of BDNF (pro-BDNF; Figure 4A) in the cortex. However, senescence reduced the abundance of mature form of BDNF (m-BDNF; 6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.049; Figure 4B), which was prevented by SDP supplementation (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.030).
Gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1β and Il-6 was increased in the cortex of aged mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively; Figure 5A,B), as was the abundance of p65-NF-κB (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.023; Figure 5C). Supplementation with SDP reduced the gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (both p = 0.014) and attenuated the effect of aging on the abundance of p65-NF-κB (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.043). In addition, aged mice showed decreased gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Tgf-β compared with young mice (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.037; Figure 5D). SDP supplementation prevented this decrease (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.041) and also increased the concentration of IL-10 in the cortex of senescent mice (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.022; Figure 5E).
Moreover, the gene expression of toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2) was higher in senescent mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.012; Figure 6A), and SDP supplementation prevented this age-associated increase (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.030). On the other hand, no effects of aging or diet were observed for Tlr4, Cd14, and Myd88 gene expression (Figure 6B–D, respectively). The gene expression of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (Trif) was increased in the cortex by senescence (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.018; Figure 6E). Conversely, the concentration of LPS in the cortex was not modified by aging or diet (Figure 6F).
3.4. Systemic Effects
Aging has been previously described to increase systemic inflammation in SAMP8 mice. Of note, senescence increased systemic inflammation by augmenting the concentration of LPS (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.032; Figure 7A), and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in the serum of aged mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.021 and p < 0.001; Figure 7B,C, respectively), and SDP supplementation reduced the concentration of both cytokines in senescent mice (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.004 and p = 0.011, respectively). Furthermore, SDP supplementation tended to increase the serum concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.066; Figure 7D).
3.5. Gut Microbiota
The Shannon’s index, used as a reflection of the diversity of species in a community, was similar in the different groups (Figure 8A). The number of species in feces (species richness) was not modified by age or SDP supplementation (Figure 8B). The gut microbiota of these mice predominantly comprised Bacteroidetes (42.4%–44.3%; Figure 8D–F) and Firmicutes (30.7%–38.0%), which constituted the dominant phyla, and their ratio (F/B) was not modified by age or SDP supplementation (Figure 7C). They were followed by Proteobacteria (14.2%–15.5%), Verrucomicrobia (0.5%–6.7%), Actinobacteria (0.4%–0.8%), Tenericutes (0.6%–1.0%), Deferribacteres (0.2%–0.5%), and others. No significant differences could be attributed to age or SDP supplementation.
The effects of age and SDP supplementation at the family level are shown in Table 1. Senescence reduced the abundance of the families Lactobacillaceae and Clostridiaceae, from the Firmicutes phylum; Sphingobacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Prevotellaceae, from Bacteroidetes phylum; and Helicobacteraceae, from the Proteobacteria phylum (6M-CTL vs. 2M; all q < 0.05); whereas increased Erysipelotrichaceae, from the Firmicutes phylum (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q < 0.05); and Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, from the Bacteroidetes phylum (6M-CTL vs. 2M; both, q < 0.1). On the other hand, SDP supplementation prevented the effect of aging on the Lactobacillaceae family and increased the relative abundance of the Eubacteriaceae family (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; both q < 0.05).
At the genus level and within the Firmicutes phylum, senescence reduced the relative abundance of the anti-inflammatory genera Lactobacillus and Pediococcus (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q = 0.009 and q < 0.001, respectively; Figure 9A,B) and SDP supplementation prevented these reductions (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.040 and q = 0.006, respectively). Furthermore, SDP supplementation increased the abundance of the acetyl-CoA producer Acetobacterium (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.063; Figure 9C). The abundance of the pathogenic bacteria Erysipelothrix was increased in aged mice compared with young mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q = 0.038; Figure 9D). SDP supplementation reduced it (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.084) and also reduced the relative abundance of the pathogenic bacteria Johnsonella (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.039, Figure 9E). Besides, aging reduced Clostridium abundance (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q = 0.007, Figure 9F), but SDP had no effects on its abundance.
At the genus level and considering the Bacteroidetes phylum, senescence increased Bacteroides abundance (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q < 0.001; Figure 10A), although no effect of SDP supplementation was observed. Aging reduced the relative abundance of Prevotella and SDP supplementation has no effect (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q = 0.013; Figure 10B). Senescence reduced levels of Odoribacter (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q < 0.001; Figure 10C) and SDP supplementation attenuated this effect (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.071). The Parabacteroides genus was increased in aged mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; q = 0.022, Figure 10D) and there was no effect of SDP supplementation.
At the species level, aging reduced the abundance of several species of the Lactobacillus genus such as L. taiwanensis, L. siliginis, L. antri and L. intermedius as well as Pediococcus argentinicus (6M-CTL vs. 2M; all q < 0.05; Table 2), and SDP supplementation prevented this effect on L. siliginis levels (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q = 0.047). Aged mice showed an increase in some species of Bacteroides spp., along with Erysipelothrix muris and Parabacteroides gordonii (6M-CTL vs. 2M; all q < 0.05), and a reduction in Helicobacter mastomyrinus and Prevotella dentasini (6M-CTL vs. 2M; both q < 0.05). SDP supplementation reduced the abundance of Erysipelohtrix muris, Helicobacter mastomyrinus, Bacteroides denticanum, and Bifidobacterium choerinum (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; all q < 0.05) as well as Parabacteroides gordonii (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q < 0.1) and increased Parabacteroides goldsteinii (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; q < 0.05).
3.6. Effects on Colon Tissue
Gene expression analysis revealed that senescence increased the colonic expression of Tlr2 and Tlr4 (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.005 and p = 0.029; Figure 11A,B, respectively) and SDP supplementation prevented both increases (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.025, and p = 0.018, respectively). In addition, aging augmented the gene expression of Cd14 in the colonic mucosa (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.015; Figure 11C), whereas SDP supplementation attenuated this increase (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.019). Likewise, Myd88 gene expression was also increased in the colonic mucosa of aged mice compared with the young group (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.007; Figure 11D). No effect was observed of aging or SDP supplementation on Trif gene expression (Figure 11E).
Gene expression of Ffar2 (which encodes GPR43) and Ffar3 (which encodes GPR41) was reduced in the colon tissue of aged mice (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.023 and p = 0.001; Figure 11F,G, respectively), whereas SDP supplementation increased the expression of both genes (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.033 and p = 0.032, respectively).
In aged mice, the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-1β, Il-6, Tnf-α) was augmented in the colonic mucosa (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.001, p = 0.005 and p = 0.002; Figure 12A–C, respectively), and SDP supplementation prevented the effects of aging on Il-6, and Tnf-α (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.045 and p = 0.015, respectively). Aging increased the gene expression of Cd25 and F4/80 (6M-CTL vs. 2M; both p = 0.005; Figure 12D,E, respectively), whereas SDP supplementation prevented these increases (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.031 and p = 0.008, respectively). Itgae was increased in control and SDP-treated senescent mice (p = 0.038 and p = 0.023, respectively; Figure 12F).
Senescence also impaired the intestinal barrier by reducing the gene expression of Tff3, Muc2, and Occludin (6M-CTL vs. 2M; p = 0.011, p = 0.016, and p = 0.039; Figure 13A–C, respectively). SDP supplementation prevented all of these aging-associated changes (6M-SDP vs. 6M-CTL; p = 0.014, p = 0.022, and p = 0.045, respectively).
