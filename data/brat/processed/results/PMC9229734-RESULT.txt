3.1. Subjects of the Study
The study was conducted on a total of 75 Caucasian healthy elderly male and female subjects. The 75 enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to receive one mixture of prebiotic formulation (A group) or synbiotic formulation (B group) or placebo (D group) once daily (the first day was T0) for 28 days (T28); then the subjects attended 28 days of follow-up (T56) (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the volunteers of each group are presented in Table 1.
Concerning the age, we recorded a mean age of 70.08 ± 4.61 years in the synbiotic group, 68.76 ± 4.95 years in the prebiotic group, and 69.76 ± 5.20 years in the placebo group. Besides, the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 22.74 ± 1.38 Kg/m2 in the synbiotic group, 22.77 ± 1.68 Kg/m2 in the prebiotic group, and 23.25 ± 1.89 Kg/m2 in the placebo group. These characteristics were consistent with the specific inclusion criteria of the study. Among the treatment groups, demographic and benchmark features were comparable, denoting unbiased randomization.
All subjects included in the safety analysis dataset provided written informed consent before initiation of any study-related procedures. A questionnaire and an explanation of the protocol of the study were given to the subjects, including information about factors related to the modification of gut microbiota, such as the use of medications, the level of physical activity, tobacco use, and consumption of different food and supplement. Symptoms questionnaire was performed as an interview during the medical examination with the enrolled subjects at the time-points of the study.
3.2. Gut Microbiota Profile of Recruited Participants during the Treatment
For each subject, fecal samples were collected, and DNA was extracted for the gut microbiota analysis. The V3-V4 region of 16S rDNA sequencing of the gut microbiota resulted in a total 24.952.554 reads. After DADA2 filtering step, we obtained a total of 16.813.759 reads with an average of 70.350 ± 57.098 reads for each sample, resulting in 14.839 ASVs. A total of 16 phyla, 24 classes, 38 orders, 69 families, and 215 genera were identified (Table S4). Analysis of taxonomic profiles indicated a dominance of bacteria belonging to the following five phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria. Figure 2 reports the relative abundances of these phyla in the analyzed datasets.
Moreover, considering the three groups in terms of relative abundances across the different time-points of the study, the most represented ASVs are assigned to Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, Alistipes, Subdoligranulum, Akkermansia, Roseburia, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Phascolarctobacterium (Figure S1). In addition, although present in a no consistent manner, even the ASVs belonging to Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, Veionella, Dorea, Butyricicoccus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were observed. Interestingly, the majority of the bacteria related to these ASVs positively influence the host gut metabolic processes.
In order to evaluate the core microbiome of the three groups after the treatment (T28), we decided to compare the ASVs in a Venn Diagram. The results showed that 59% of ASVs were shared by the three groups, while the A, B, and D groups were dominated by ASV percentages of 6%, 7%, and 11%, respectively (Figure 3). A similar distribution was maintained at the end of the follow-up period (T56).
3.3. Gut Microbiome Diversity in Elderly Subjects
Bacterial diversity of the three groups (alpha diversity) was used to estimate the changes of biodiversity in the intervals of the three (successive/non-successive) time-points within each treatment-group. First of all, at the starting point (T0) (employing Mann-Whitney signed-rank test at two levels of significance) there was not a significant difference among the A, B, and D groups of the study. The pairwise difference test showed that there were no significant differences in Faith PD value in the interval between T0 and T28 for the three treatment groups. Both synbiotic (B group) and prebiotic (A group) treatments showed a significant increase between the initial and the final time-points (T0–T56) showing a p-value of 0.045 and 0.02, respectively. No significant increase was evidenced in the interval between T28 and T56, except for the placebo treatment (D group) (Table S5).
In order to analyze the variation of the biodiversity among the three groups in the different time-points intervals, the pairwise group comparison test (employing Mann-Whitney test at two levels of significance) was applied. The Mann-Whitney test showed a significant variation between A versus D and B versus D groups after the administration period (T0–T28) (Figure 4a). Indeed, the boxplot showing the difference in Faith PD value of the interval T0–T28, highlights a significant difference of A and B groups with respect to D group (A vs. D U-value = 149 with p-value 0.02; B vs. D U-value = 301 with p-value 0.04). Considering the difference in Faith PD value between the baseline and the end of the follow-up (T0–T56), no significant difference was evidenced between A vs. D group and B vs. D (p-value > 0.05) (Figure 4b). Likewise, Figure 4c, representing the interval between T28 and T56, shows no significant difference from the comparison of A vs. D groups and B vs. D groups (p-value > 0.05). Overall, these results indicated that the synbiotic treatment led to a higher biodiversity variation after 28 days of treatment and the biodiversity is maintained until the end of the follow-up (T56).
In order to thoroughly evaluate the variation of microbiota biodiversity between groups, the analysis of microbiota maturity (measured as MAZ score) was performed. We used a volatility graph (Figure 5) for assessing how MAZ score changed over time in each group. Figure 5, depicted as trend lines (representing the pattern observed for all the subjects of each group in the various time-points), shows a similar behaviour for both the prebiotic (A group) and the synbiotic (B group) treatments, while the placebo (D group) shows a different and stable trend.
The calculated MAZ scores indicated an increase of the community richness in A and B groups with respect to D group after the intake (T28). At the final time-point, there was a slight regression even if the MAZ score value remains higher in the synbiotic group compared to the prebiotic group. In general, the maturity analysis shows that the intake of synbiotic (B group) causes a variation in the structure of the microbial communities mainly at time T28. In addition, to appreciate the variation in microbiota biodiversity, a supervised learning regression was used to identify the most important ASVs able to promote a microbial shift in the treated groups across time. The analysis reveals that 50 different ASVs participated to discriminate the groups and that 12 ASVs belonging to Bacteroides, Alistipes, Blautia, Lachnospira, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Subdoligranulum (p-value < 0.05) were the most abundant (Figure 6). In particular, among the ASVs that mostly contributed to the variation of the community biodiversity, the ASVs belonging to Bacteroides (ASVs 1819 and 6420) and Subdoligranulum_5538 showed a high variation in the A group at T56; while those belonging to Blautia_2926, Lachnospira_1103, Lachnospiraceae_4093, and Roseburia_6213 showed a lower frequency of variation at both T28 and T56. Faecalibacterium (ASVs 7470 and 7065) showed instability, reverting at time T56. The synbiotic treatment, instead, influenced Faecalibacterium (ASVs 7470 and 7065) to a highly stable frequency for all the duration of the study. Regarding the other ASVs mostly contributing to the variation in B group, we can observe that Alistipes_4404, Bacteroides_2258, and Subdoligranulum_5538 showed a frequency varying especially during the administration period. Concerning the ASVs frequency in the D group, we can affirm that no significant variation during the time of treatment was observed.
3.4. Effects of the Synbiotic Intake on the Most Relevant Taxa
Often the bacteria with an immuno-modulatory role and producing several beneficial effects on the host are not the most abundant within the human intestinal microbiota. In this context, an additional goal of the present work was the assessment of the synbiotic administration effectiveness on the intestinal microbiota taxa with a crucial role in gut metabolic functions. First, we evaluated the significant biodiversity variation of the gut microbiota community within synbiotic group with respect to the other two treatment-groups in the intervals of the three (successive/non-successive) time-points (employing Mann-Whitney test at two levels of significance). The ASVs that varied significantly are reported in Supplementary Materials (Figure S2). Among these, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus ASVs were considered for their high rate of variation and for their relevance in inducing gut metabolism changes (Figure 7).
Summing the number of ASVs that showed a significant relative abundance variation at different intervals of time, we generated a differential bar plot. Positive cumulative variation (ASVs with positive abundance variation) is depicted with green bars and negative cumulative variation (ASVs with negative abundance variation) with red bars (Figure 8). The synbiotic treatment generated an increase of the ASVs number with a positive abundance variation (green bars) during all the intervals of time (T0–T28, T0–T56, and T28–T56) (Figure 8); and it generated a decrease of the ASVs number with a negative abundance variation (red bars). This can be appreciated by observing the specific positive variation (green squares) of the following ASVs: Blautia_0075, Faecalibacterium_1240, Faecalibacterium_7448, Ruminococcus 1_2436, Ruminococcus 2_1431, and Ruminococcus 2_3960 reported in the heat map of Figure 7 (T0–T28). During the follow-up period, the synbiotic treatment highlighted an increase of specific features (Bifidobacterium_3652, Prevotella 9_2238, and _4937) that in the prebiotic were not induced, although the placebo modulated diversely these two taxa. On the contrary, both the prebiotic and the placebo treatments induced a decrease of the ASVs number with a positive abundance variation during the two intervals T0–T28 and T0–T56. During the follow-up period (T28–T56), an increase of the ASVs number with a negative abundance variation is evidenced in the prebiotic and in the placebo groups. Nevertheless, the prebiotic intake induced a counterbalanced effect between T28 and T56, indeed the ASVs variation is comparable both in positive and in negative directions. Likewise, the D group demonstrated to have a similar response (Figure 8).
The assembled data could suggest that the synbiotic administration promotes a significant modulation of specific bacterial genera and/or combination of specific bacterial taxa of the gut microbiota contributing to the metabolic shifting, i.e., SCFA producers.
3.5. Effect of the Synbiotic on Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.
Commonly, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species within the intestinal microbiota are very low, particularly in the elderly people, although their beneficial properties. Considering these species, we observed around 30 and 70 ASVs belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, respectively. Interestingly, the number of Bifidobacterium ASVs increased after the synbiotic intake (T28), and a similar effect was evidenced by the prebiotic treatment towards both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium at T28. Instead, in the placebo group, a stable number of bacteria belonging to these genera with small physiological fluctuations was observed for the entire study. In order to specifically quantify the amount of bacteria belonging to the same species of the probiotics administered within the synbiotic i.e., Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the total DNA extracted from fecal samples (A, B, and D groups) was used to perform a qPCR analysis with species-specific primers (after sample collection at the times T0, T28, and T56). The qPCR analysis demonstrated that at time T0 in all the subjects of the three groups the average of the total cell amount of L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and B. lactis was around 104 CFU/mL g, 105 CFU/mL g, and 106 CFU/mL g, respectively (Figure 9).
In general, an increasing trend in the amount of these probiotic bacteria was observed in the treatment with the synbiotic (B group). Specifically, at time T28, a significantly higher amount of L. plantarum (p-value < 0.01) and B. lactis (p-value < 0.01) with respect to time T0 was evidenced in B group; furthermore, at the same time-point, L. plantarum and B. lactis were statistically higher compared to both A and D groups (p-value < 0.01: comparison of L. plantarum B vs. D, and B. lactis B vs. D; p-value < 0.05: comparison of L. plantarum A vs. B and B. lactis A vs. B, respectively) (Figure 9 panel A and C). The amount of L. acidophilus was stable and statistically higher with respect to both A (p-value < 0.05) and D (p-value < 0.01) groups at T28 (Figure 9 panel B). At time T56 different trends were detected. The amount of L. plantarum in B group was significantly higher, by two orders of magnitude compared to T28 (p-value < 0.05 T0 vs. T56). Instead, the amount of L. acidophilus and B. lactis decreased. Nonetheless, at T56 the total amount of B. lactis is comparable to the level of A group.
Overall, these results indicate that the synbiotic contributed to enhance the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species within the gut microbial community after their ingestion for 28 days. Meanwhile, the persistence of the synbiotic strains in the gut system likely needs a longer period of administration.
3.6. Impact of Synbiotic Intake on Common Infectious Disease Incidence
The incidence of common infectious disease (CID) of the subjects was monitored during the entire study period. No subjects were drop-out or lost in the follow-up period and no adverse effects that are related to the administration of the treatments were recorded. The treatment efficacy in terms of CID symptom amelioration was evaluated both as the number of subjects that recorded at least one symptom of CID throughout the whole study (T0–T56), during the uptake period (T0–T28), and during the follow-up period (T28–T56), and as the average of days with one or more CID episodes.
Collected data highlighted that during both the uptake and the follow-up period (T0–T28 and T28–T56), B group experienced a minor percentage of subjects (36% and 12%) that had at least one CID episode with respect to A (48% and 20%) and D (56% and 20%) groups. Furthermore, considering the total period of the study (T0–T56), the same pattern was observed: the percentage of subjects that had at least one CID episode was minor in the synbiotic group (48%) with respect to placebo (76%) and prebiotic (68%) groups. Moreover, a lower percentage of subjects of B group presented the persistence of CID (20%) compared to the other two treated groups (A 24% and D 32%). Overall, these data indicated the synbiotic effectiveness in reducing the incidence of CID symptoms.
Considering the average number of days linked to CID, 5 ± 2 days was the average for B group (3 ± 1 during the administration period and 2 ± 1 during the follow-up period) and it was statistically lower than the average of the prebiotic (p-value < 0.05) and the control (p-value < 0.01) groups (Figure 10). Curiously, the average day number of the follow-up period of B group was significantly reduced (p-value < 0.05) with respect to D group, suggesting the persistence of the positive effect in the synbiotic group.
3.7. Immunological Markers Analysis
Since the gastrointestinal and the respiratory tracts are two interconnected systems, the immune reactivity was measured through the fecal calprotectin, the fecal β-defensin2, the salivary IgA, and the salivary TAC markers.
Regarding fecal markers, Figure 11 shows the subject percentage presenting the fecal calprotectin level below 45 µg/g that is considered physiological for elderly people. At the beginning of the study, 88% of the subjects of B group had normal levels of this fecal marker that after the synbiotic intake shifted in terms of number of subjects to 96% (T28) and 100% (T56) showing calprotectin level below 45 µg/g. Despite few unusual marker values, the calprotectin levels of prebiotic and placebo groups were stable during the study, presenting during the follow-up period 84% and 92% of subjects with calprotectin level below 45 µg/g, respectively.
Data on the fecal β-defensin2 levels showed that the amount increased in all three groups (Figure 12). In particular, the synbiotic enhanced significantly (p-value < 0.05) the β-defensin2 levels with around 22% increase with respect to the beginning of the treatment (T0–T56). In addition, the levels of B group at the end of the follow-up period were statistically higher compared to both A (p-value < 0.05) and D (p-value < 0.05) groups. Although the subjects of the placebo group evidenced an increase at the end of the administration (p-value < 0.05), these values were not comparable to the ones of the synbiotic group. Even the prebiotic group presented a significant shift of these marker levels (p-value < 0.05) just at the first endpoint (25% increase with respect to the beginning of the treatment).
The elderly immune system associated with the respiratory tract is often characterized by the decrease of IgA and the increase of reactive oxygen species contributing to a state of senescence. Considering the salivary IgA values (Figure 13), the levels increased only for the synbiotic group (2% at T28 and 8% at T56 with respect to the beginning of the study, not in a significant manner), in line with the levels registered in elderly people. For A and D groups, the levels decreased similarly at T28 (around 4.5%) and at T56 the prebiotic group decreased much more than the placebo group.
Finally, the TAC parameter measured by FRAP assay did not show important shifts after the treatments, except for the synbiotic intake that resulted in a significant increase of TAC levels between T0–T28 (p-value < 0.05) (Figure 14). Indeed, A and D groups presented stable TAC levels with an average of around 523 µmol considering both T28 and T56.
