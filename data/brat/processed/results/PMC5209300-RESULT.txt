3.1 Stool bacterial community diversity and composition
To investigate effects of supplementation with SRB or NBP on stool bacterial communities, richness (total number of OTUs detected), diversity (relative abundance of OTUs present), and composition were measured. Stool bacterial richness and diversity were calculated using Sobs (number of species observed), Chao1, and Simpson diversity indices. The Chao1 richness estimate is used to approximate the number of species potentially not detected due to incomplete sampling using bootstrapping. With SRB supplementation, richness and diversity in stool were not altered at day 14, but were significantly higher than baseline at day 28 (Fig. 1). Stool richness, as estimated by the Chao index, was also increased at day 28 but not day 14 with NBP supplementation (Fig. 1). No changes in richness or diversity were observed in samples from individuals consuming the control diet.
To assess potential shifts in stool community structure, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) including all treatment time points was conducted. Consequently, AMOVA tests were used to compare stool communities at 14 and 28 days to baseline and revealed no significant changes in overall stool community structure in any of the dietary intervention treatment groups (p < 0.05).
Stool microbial composition on a phyla level showed significant changes with SRB. Overall, SRB supplementation increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of Firmicutes resulting in a significantly lower Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio (F:B ratio) at 14 days compared to baseline (Figure 2). Individuals varied in retention of the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio shift after 28 days of SRB consumption, resulting in no significant difference at 28 days relative to baseline. No changes in microbial composition at the phyla level were detected over time in the NBP or control diet groups.
For each treatment group, differentially abundant OTUs at 14 and 28 days relative to baseline were detected using the software package metastats. No OTUs differed from baseline at either timepoint in the control group. In the NBP group, two OTUs at day 14 and five OTUs at day 28 differentiated the microbial community from baseline (Table S2). At 14 days, Bacteroides fragilis decreased and an unclassified Lachnobacterium increased in mean abundance relative to the NBP baseline microbial community. The reduction in mean abundance of Bacteroides fragilis persisted at 28 days and an unclassified Clostridium and Anaerostipes also had lower mean abundance with NBP. In addition, two OTUs had increased mean abundance at 28 days with NBP including an unclassified Lachnospira and Coprococcus. In the NBP group, four OTUs at day 14 and two OTUs at day 28 differentiated the microbial community from baseline (Table S2).
With SRB at 14 days, an unclassified Ruminococcus and unclassified Ethanoligenens were decreased in mean abundance relative to the baseline SRB microbial community. Conversely, an unclassified Coprococcus and Bacteroides ovatus were increased in mean abundance at 14 days. Bacteroides ovatus showed the second largest increase of any microorganism in this study with a 20-fold increase relative to baseline mean abundance. In addition, eight OTUs were newly detected and eleven OTUs were no longer detected as differential members at14 days compared to the baseline bacterial community (Table S2). The number of OTUs discriminating the bacterial community at 28 days from baseline with SRB was larger than at 14 days (69 versus 23 OTUs). In addition, the largest increase in any single OTU occurred at 28 days with a 24-fold increase in Lachnobacterium relative to baseline mean abundance (Table S2).
3.2 Estimating change in functional potential of stool bacteria
The software package PICRUSt was used as a predictive tool to infer the content of the genome of each bacterium in a community as identified by a 16S rRNA sequencing. This genome was then correlated with a specific functional category as assigned in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for understanding high-level functions of the gut microbial community. Differences in genetic function across treatments and time points in KEGG functional categories can be found using the software package STAMP. Although not a perfect substitute for metagenomic sequencing, this approach allows for developing hypotheses related to the microbial community functions of the gut following dietary intervention.
Baseline differences between treatment groups were quite large and ultimately we were looking for responses to specific intervention foods. Therefore, we focused our analysis on a comparison of the 14 and 28-day time points from baseline for each food treatment group, and did not make comparisons between SRB and NBP groups. Several microbial metabolic functions were significantly enriched (p< 0.05) with SRB at 14 days compared to baseline (Figure 3). These functions included “Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids”, “Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “Other glycan degradation”, “Starch and sucrose metabolism”, “Streptomycin biosynthesis”, and “Sphingolipid metabolism” (Figure 3). The most significantly decreasec KEGG functional category was for “Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids”, which represent a significant portion of SRB composition. No significant differences in KEGG functional categories were found at 28 days with SRB, or after 14 or 28 days for the control or NBP interventions when compared to baseline.
3.3 Targeted analysis of stool metabolites
SRB and NBP both contain highly fermentable carbohydrates that can be metabolized by gut bacteria to secondary byproducts such as SCFAs, particularly acetate, propionate and butyrate. Given that functional genes for “Starch and sucrose metabolism” were enriched at 14 days with SRB, SCFAs were quantified to assess potential changes in stool microbial metabolites that resulted with SRB and NBP supplementation. No significant changes in stool SCFAs were observed at 14 or 28 days with the NBP intervention when compared to baseline (Figure 4a); however a large amount of inter-individual variation was observed in this group that could possibly obscure treatment effects. With SRB, no significant changes in stool butyric acid were observed at 14 or 28 days. However, both acetic and propionic acids were significantly increased with SRB at 14 days (p < 0.05); a change that did not persist at 28 days relative to baseline (Figure 4b). Acetic and propionic acids are byproducts of sugar, starch, and glycan fermentation and correspond with the observed enrichment in related metabolic genes at 14 days relative to baseline with SRB. Stool isobutyric and isovaleric acids were also measured based upon increases seen at 4 weeks with SRB consumption in our pilot study. However, these BCFA were below detection limits in all participants using the current study participants and protocols.
Based on differences previously reported for bile acids at 28 days following SRB intake, we quantified deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid with the current study participants receiving SRB. Stool bile acid concentrations were highly variable across time points with SRB (Figure S1), with primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic trending downward at day 14. Microbial metabolites of polyphenols, including benzoic acid, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid, phenylacetic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid were also measured. None of the targeted polyphenol metabolites differed significantly in stool across time points or treatment groups (p < 0.05).
