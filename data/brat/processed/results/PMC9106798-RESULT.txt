Baseline Characteristics
Of the twenty volunteers that were randomized, six subjects were lost during follow-up (Figure 2). The fourteen participants that completed the study, 12 women and 2 men, were healthy, in the min-max age span between 20 and 46 years and with a median body mass index (BMI) of 22.2 kg/m2 (Table 2). The background diet (measured before run-in) of the participants consisted of a total fat intake in the upper range of the recommendation with a median intake of 36.5 E%. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) were higher than recommended (12.3 E%), while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were in the lower range (13.6 E% and 6.1 E%, respectively). Intake of proteins and carbohydrates were 17.6 E% and 42.9 E%, respectively. Total fiber intake was high with a median intake of 35.8 g per day for the total group (Table 3).

Glycemic Regulation After Intake of Granola With Cereal Beta-Glucan
After three days of intervention, the effect of granola meals with different doses of beta-glucan on glycemic response was determined on the fourth day over a 3h period after an OGTT. Glycemic response was improved with granola intervention containing cereal beta-glucan, although not in a dose-response manner. While the fasting glucose level significantly decreased within the high beta-glucan intervention, there were no difference between groups (Figure 3A and Table 4). Fasting insulin levels were significantly reduced after intervention with medium (P = 0.004) and high (P = 0.006) beta-glucan meals, compared with baseline (Figure 4A and Table 4). The post-prandial blood glucose response (iAUC) was significantly reduced after intervention with the medium beta-glucan meal compared with baseline (P = 0.011), low (P = 0.016) and high (P = 0.019) beta-glucan meals (Figure 3B). Also, the insulin post-prandial response (iAUC) was reduced after intake of medium beta-glucan meal compared with baseline P = 0.019), low (P = 0.011) and high (P = 0.004) beta-glucan meals (Figure 4B). We further examined two indices, HOMA-IR and Matsuda index, reflecting insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity, respectively (Table 5). There were no differences in HOMA-IR after intake of the different amounts of beta-glucan. Matsuda index significantly increased after intake of medium (66.8%) and high (29.2%) beta-glucan meals compared with baseline (P = 0.016, P = 0.041, respectively), indicating improved insulin sensitivity (Table 5).

Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 and Peptide YY After Intake of Granola With Cereal Beta-Glucan
Despite a reduction in insulin levels, there were no significant changes in GLP-2 after intervention (fasting and post-prandial) (Figure 5). The fasting level of PYY significantly increased in a dose-responsive manner of beta-glucan content following interventions. Intervention with both medium and high beta-glucan meals increased fasting PYY compared with the low beta-glucan meal (P = 0.022 and P = 0.001, respectively). In addition, intervention with the high beta-glucan meal increased fasting PYY compared with medium beta-glucan meal (P = 0.041) (Figure 5).

Breath H2 and Short Chain Fatty Acids as Markers of Gut Fermentation Activity
Microbial fermentation activity was measured by monitoring breath H2 and SCFA in plasma. A beta-glucan dose-dependent increase in fasting breath H2 was shown, but this was not reflected in the post-prandial response (iAUC) after the OGTT (Figures 6A,B). SCFA are end products of gut microbiota fermentation and are absorbed into the circulation. After three days of intervention with beta-glucan, fasting plasma levels of acetate and butyrate increased independently of dose, compared with baseline (Figure 7). In addition, the plasma level of butyrate also increased after intervention with the high beta-glucan meal compared with the low beta-glucan meal (P = 0.041). There were no significant changes in propionate (Figure 7). We also investigated the correlation between the glycemia response and the SCFA. Fasting acetate was negatively correlated with glucose response (AUC) (r = 0.338, P = 0.011). Propionate was positively correlated with fasting insulin (r = 0.269, P = 0.045) and insulin response (iAUC) (r = 0.263, P = 0.050) (Data not shown).

Significant differences are calculated with Friedman’s Anova followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. *H2 response (0–180 min) after low, medium, and high beta-glucan significant different from baseline. #H2 response (0–180 min) after high beta-glucan significant different from low and medium beta-glucan.

Intervention Effect on the Gut Microbiota
The gut microbiota of the participants was analyzed in feces, and interestingly, all the participants were dominated by Firmicutes (mean abundance of 77%), followed by Bacteroidetes (13%) and Actinobacteria (6%) at baseline. Even though a high inter-individual variability in microbiota composition was found between the participants, explaining ∼70% of the total variation, a significant intervention effect (P < 0.001) was also evident. The intervention effect explained ∼6% of the total variation between the visits. There was a dose-dependent discrimination power (per meal vs. representative baseline) of 35%, 43.7%, 56.6% for the low, medium and high beta-glucan meals, respectively. However, the intervention had no significant impact on the microbial diversity (all metrics P > 0.1).
Overview of the genera significantly affected by one of the three test meals is presented in Figure 8, shown as effect size per test meal compared to representative baseline. Highest positive effect size was of Haemophilus, followed by Veillonella and Sutterella. This effect was common for all the three test meals, but with largest effect with the high beta-glucan meal. Streptococcus, Dialister, and Bacteroides were also positively affected by the high beta-glucan meal. The medium beta-glucan meal was reflected by positive effect size of Butyricimonas and a slight effect of Akkermansia. Specific for the low beta-glucan meal was positive effect sizes of Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Roseburia and Faecalibacterium.
Bacterial taxa after intake of granola with cereal beta-glucan. The taxa order is sorted from high to low effect size independent on test meal. The effect sizes were calculated as the difference in log ratio group means of test meals vs representative baseline after adjusting for individual differences. Asterisk indicates significant relationship (VIP > 1). Bars are colored according to dose of beta-glucan. Dominating genera (average abundance > 1%) are indicated in bold. Phyla are indicated within parentheses, A: Actinobacteria, B: Bacteroidetes, F: Firmicutes, P: Proteobacteria, V: Verrucomicrobia.
We further investigated to what extent the observed differences in biomarkers of metabolic regulation were related to the genera (Figure 9). The taxa were sorted according to the correlation with insulin iAUC, the primary end point in the study. Indeed, several of the bacterial taxa that were affected by the beta-glucan meals showed correlation to biomarkers of glycemic response. Of them, highest negative correlation to insulin iAUC was observed for Akkermansia, while Streptococcus and Actinomyces were highly positively correlated to insulin iAUC. Negative correlation to fasting insulin was observed for Akkermansia, Prevotella, Sutterella and Haemophilus, and the opposite observed for Bifidobacterium.

The bacterial taxa are sorted from negative (blue) to positive (red) correlation toward insulin iAUC, and those affected by the test meals are indicated in bold. Significant relationship was set to VIP > 1 and indicated by asterisk. No relationship was determined between the bacteria and glucose fasting, GLP-2 iAUC or H2 iAUC. Phyla are indicated within parentheses. A: Actinobacteria; B: Bacteroidetes; F: Firmicutes; Glu: Glucose; GLP-2: Glucagon-like peptide 2; H2: Hydrogen; iAUC: Incremental area under the curve; Ins: Insulin; P: Proteobacteria; PYY: Peptide YY; V: Verrucomicrobia.
Positive correlation to fasting PYY was among others observed for Bacteroides and Roseburia, while the latter was negatively correlated to PYY iAUC as well as Haemophilus, Veillonella and Sutterella. The SCFA acetate and butyrate, both affected by the beta-glucan meals, were both positively correlated with Sutterella and Bacteroides. Acetate was also positively correlated to Akkermansia, while butyrate was highest correlated to Haemophilus and Roseburia (Figure 9).
No relationship was determined between the bacteria and fasting glucose, GLP-2 iAUC or breath H2 iAUC (Figure 9).
Physiochemical Properties of Test Meals
To characterize the physiochemical properties of the different test meals, including viscosity, the test meals were subjected to an in vitro digestion (Table 1). Viscosity after digestion was high for the high beta-glucan test meal (114 mPas), reflecting the high beta-glucan dose, molecular weight and relatively good solubility (40% of total beta-glucan was solubilized during simulated digestion). The medium beta-glucan test meal had a lower viscosity (3.2 mPas) due to a lower dose and lower solubility (28%). The low beta-glucan test meal exhibited a viscosity similar to water (1.1 mPas). Under physiological conditions (e.g., in vitro digestion), the medium beta-glucan test meal had the highest amount of insoluble, indigestible carbohydrate (20.4 g/100 g), followed by the low beta-glucan test meal (18.2 g/100 g) and the high beta-glucan test meal (17.4 g/100 g). This difference was due to glucose polymers, e.g., insoluble beta-glucan, cellulose and resistant starch, while insoluble arabinoxylans did not differ between test meals (Table 1).
