2.1. Gut Microbiota Diversity Variation after PC or IR Supplementation
The overall structural changes of gut microbiota in response to PC or IR administration were determined by analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of microbial samples isolated from the feces of Control, PC, and IR mouse groups. UniFrac distance-based principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct clustering of intestinal microbe communities for each experimental group.
Remarkable changes in the microbiota community structure were induced by both PC and IR intervention. The microbes in the IR and control groups were more closely clustered in comparison with the PC and control groups, which indicates that PC consumption induced more significant microbial composition changes (Figure 2A). Venn diagram analysis indicated the shared richness of gut microbiota in different groups (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we compared the relative abundance of the predominant taxa in the three groups. At the phylum level, all fecal samples shared similar community structures. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, representing more than 80% of the relative abundance (Figure 2C). The relative abundance of Spirochaetota, Actinobacteriota, Desulfobacterota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Deferribacterota were decreased in the PC or IR-treated mice (Figure 2C). The relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were increased in the mice after PC or IR treatment (Figure 2C). At the genus level, we observed that the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Dubosiella, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides were increased after PC or IR supplementation (Figure 2D).
Figure 2E presents the microbiota with significant differences. IR treatment significantly boosted Parabacteroides and Alloprevotella abundance and significantly decreased Allobaculum abundance. PC treatment significantly increased Parabacteroides and Bacteroides abundance.
2.2. SCFA Concentrations Variation in Feces after PC or IR Supplementation
The dominated SCFA in feces in different groups are acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which account for over 90% of the total SCFA (Figure 3A). The contents of acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids in the feces of the PC group were significantly higher than that of the control group (Figure 3A), while IR treatment had no distinct effect on the content of SCFA in feces (Figure 3A).
The results of correlation analysis (Figure 3B) revealed there was a significant positive correlation between acetic acid levels and Dubosiella, Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group, Faecalibaculum, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group. The propanoic acid levels were positively correlated with Peptococcaceae, Intestinimonas, and Oscillibacter. The butryate acid levels were positively correlated with Oscillibacter and Lachnoclostridium. The hexanoic acid levels were positively correlated with Allobaculum. The isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid levels were correlated negatively with Bifidobacterium, while correlated positively with Rikenella, norank_f_Ruminococcaceae, and Alistipes. The valeric acid levels were correlated negatively with Akkermansia, and correlated positively with Lachnoclostridium. The isohexanoic acid levels were significantly negatively correlated with Eubacterium_siraeum_group and Eubacterium_fissicatena_group.
2.3. Metabolomic Variation after PC or IR Supplementation
A volcano plot analysis was performed to visualize the metabolomic variables able to differentiate between the control group and the PC/IR group. As can be seen from Figure 4A, the volcano plot showed 144 variables that differed significantly (t-test p-value < 0.05 and abs (log2 FC) > 1) between the PC group and the control group (Supplementary Table S1), 175 variables that differed significantly between the IR group and the control group (Supplementary Table S2), and 69 variables that differed significantly between the PC group and the IR group (Supplementary Table S3). Next, a supervised Pareto scaling PLS-DA analysis was performed with these selected variables to evaluate whether they could differentiate the experimental groups and the control group, thus revealing a clear separation between the control group and the PC/IR group, as well as between the PC group and the IR group in the positive ion mode (Figure 4B). In the negative ion mode, a clear separation was observed between the control group and the PC/IR group, but no differences between the PC group and the IR group occurred (Figure 4C). Although the intercept of the Q2 regression line and the Y-axis was greater than 0.05, with the decrease in replacement retention, the regression line of R2 and Q2 showed an upward trend, indicating that there was no over-fitting phenomenon in the model (Figure 4B,C).
2.4. Altered Metabolic Pathways after PC or IR Supplementation
The metabolite pathways enrichment analysis (Figure 5) showed that some metabolic pathways, including protein digestion and absorption, gastric acid secretion, sphingolipid signaling pathway, insulin resistance, thermogenesis, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and tryptophan metabolism were significantly affected (p < 0.01) by PC. Some metabolic pathways, including purine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism were significantly affected (p < 0.01) by IR. Comparing the PC group with the IR group, the pyrimidine metabolism pathway was significantly changed (p < 0.01). Most of these pathways were involved in metabolism and human disease.
Pathway enrichment and pathway topology analysis were performed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0, which is based on high-quality KEGG metabolic pathways as the backend knowledgebase (Figure 6). Results indicated that four metabolic pathways that showed significant responses to PC treatment included glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, tryplophan metabolism, N-glycan biosynthesis, and D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism. The six metabolic pathways that showed significant responses to IR treatment included purine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, histidine metabolism, and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. Three perturbed metabolic pathways showed lower p-values and higher pathway impact between the PC and IR groups; these included pathways related to pyrimidine metabolism, histidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and purine metabolism.
