At the end of the experiment, mean body weight of the rats in the CG group had increased by 21.43%. Mean body weight had increased by 19.89% in the DMH group and by 28% in the DMH+PRE group. The highest FER (p < 0.05) was observed for the DMH+PRE group relative to the CG and DMH groups. For the CG group, the coliform count was 6.17 ± 0.56 log10 CFU/g and the lactobacilli count was 8.99 ± 0.45 log10 CFU/g. DMH injection slightly increased the coliform counts and decreased lactobacilli counts (6.34 ± 0.25 and 8.78 ± 0.37, respectively). Inulin significantly decreased the coliform counts (5.96 ± 0.22 log10 CFU/g; p < 0.01) and significantly increased the lactobacilli counts (9.38 ± 0.29 log10 CFU/g; p < 0.001) compared to the DMH group.
Changes in glycolytic enzyme activity for all groups are summarized in Table 1. DMH increased the activity of β-glucuronidase and α-glucosidase (p < 0.01) while decreasing the activity of α-galactosidase (p < 0.01). Inulin treatment significantly decreased β-GLUCUR (p < 0.01) activity and increased that of α-GAL (p < 0.01). Butyric and propionic concentrations were decreased in the DMH group (p < 0.001), and inulin increased the concentration of these two compounds (p < 0.01; Table 2). Furthermore, inulin significantly decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-2 and TNF-α, and stimulated the production of regulatory IL-10 in the jejunal mucosa. Similar tendeny of changes in proinflammatory cytokines and regulatory IL-10 were recorded in the serum (Fig. 1). The numbers of COX-2- and NFκB-positive cells in the tunica mucosae and tela submucosae of the colon are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.
