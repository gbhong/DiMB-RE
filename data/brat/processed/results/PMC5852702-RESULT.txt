All 18 participants, 10 men and eight women, that were randomized completed the study. Participants had a mean BMI of 29.7 + 4.4 kg/m2 and an age of 56.7 + 10.2 years (Table 1). 
Following demultiplexing and quality filtering, the mean and standard deviation of bacterial OTUs identified using closed reference OTU picking was 33,194 ± 9686, with a minimum of 8227 counts per sample. As such, all samples were rarefied to an even sequencing depth of 8227 for subsequent analyses. At the phyla level, more than 90% of bacterial sequences were dominated by Firmicutes (64.2%) and Bacteroidetes (27.5%), with smaller proportions of Actinobacteria (3.8%), Proteobacteria (2.0%) and Verrucomicrobia (1.6%). Forty bacterial families were identified. The top seven families, Ruminococcaceae (28.9%), Lachnospiraceae (20.4%), Bacteroidaceae (21.0%), an undefined family in the Clostridales order (8.1%), Veillonellacaea (3.3%), Bifodobacteriaceae (2.5%), and Verrucomicrobiaceae (1.6%), comprised approximately 90% of the sequences. Seventy-eight genera were classified with 21 representing greater than 90% of total sequences and 34 representing <1%; the top 10 genera, Bacteroides, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Clostridiales, an unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and an unclassified genera in the Rikenellacaeae family represented approximately 77% of total sequences classified at the genera level. 
Archaeal sequences accounted for approximated 8.4% of total sequences. Following demultiplexing and quality filtering, the mean and standard deviation of archaeal OTUs identified using closed reference OTU picking was 3081 ± 5289, with a maximum of 26,030 counts per sample and a minimum of zero counts per sample. Treatment did not impact archaea relative abundances. Fungi accounted for approximately 0.1% of total sequences; the mean and standard deviation was 256 + 560 OTUs per sample. The minimum was one OTU/sample (12 individuals), and the maximum was 2410 sequences. Study participants had more (p < 0.05) fungal OTUs when consuming the whole almonds treatment compared to the other treatment groups. 
To determine if the presence or absence of almonds in the diet affected the fecal microbiota, contrast statements were utilized to compare almond (pooled whole, whole roasted, chopped, and butter) to the control diet period. The data revealed that almond consumption decreased the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria phylum, as well as Bifidobacterium and Parabacteroides (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Lachnospira, Roseburia, Clostridium, and Dialister (p ≤ 0.05) increased when the almonds were consumed compared to the control (Table 2). To assess the effect that processing has on the microbiota, each almond group (e.g., whole, whole roasted, chopped, or butter) was contrasted against the control. These results revealed that processing differentially impacted the microbiota. Compared to the control, chopped almonds increased the relative abundance of Lachnospira, Roseburia, and Oscillospira (p < 0.05); whole roasted almonds increased (p = 0.03) the relative abundance of Lachnospira; and whole raw almonds increased (p = 0.007) the relative abundance of Dialister (Table 3). There were no differences between control and almond butter. Almond consumption did not affect bacterial alpha diversity or beta diversity measures (Supplemental Figures S1–S4).
