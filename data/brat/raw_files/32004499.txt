Precision Microbiome Modulation with Discrete Dietary Fiber Structures Directs Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production.

Dietary fibers (DFs) impact the gut microbiome in ways often considered beneficial. However, it is unknown if precise and predictable manipulations of the gut microbiota, and especially its metabolic activity, can be achieved through DFs with discrete chemical structures. Using a dose-response trial with three type-IV resistant starches (RS4s) in healthy humans, we found that crystalline and phosphate cross-linked starch structures induce divergent and highly specific effects on microbiome composition that are linked to directed shifts in the output of either propionate or butyrate. The dominant RS4-induced effects were remarkably consistent within treatment groups, dose-dependent plateauing at 35 g/day, and can be explained by substrate-specific binding and utilization of the RS4s by bacterial taxa with different pathways for starch metabolism. Overall, these findings support the potential of using discrete DF structures to achieve targeted manipulations of the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions relevant to health.
