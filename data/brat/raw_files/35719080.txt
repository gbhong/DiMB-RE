Modification of Gut Microbiota and Immune Responses via Dietary Protease in Soybean Meal-Based Protein Diets.

Plant-based protein sources such as soybean meal have low digestibility and are generally promoted accumulation of undigested proteins into the intestine by enzymatic treatments. Moreover, potential intestinal pathogens ferment undigested proteins, producing harmful substances, such as ammonia, amines and phenols, leading to an overactive immune response and diarrhea in weaned pigs. As a solution, dietary proteases hydrolyze soybean-based antinutritive factors, which negatively affect immune responses and gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary proteases (PRO) in a low-crude protein (CP) commercial diet on the immune responses and gut microbiota of weaned pigs. The experimental design consisted of three dietary treatments: a commercial diet as positive control (PC; phase1 CP = 23.71%; phase 2 CP: 22.36%), a lower CP diet than PC as negative control (NC; 0.61% less CP than PC), and NC diet supplement with 0.02% PRO. We found that PRO tended to decrease the frequency of diarrhea in the first two weeks after weaning compared with PC and NC. In addition, pigs fed PRO showed decreased TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels compared with those fed PC and NC. The PRO group had a higher relative proportion of the genus Lactobacillus and lower levels of the genus Streptococcus than the PC and NC groups. In conclusion, the addition of PRO to a low CP commercial weaned diet attenuated inflammatory responses and modified gut microbiota in weaned pigs.
