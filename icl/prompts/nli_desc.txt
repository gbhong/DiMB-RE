I will provide a bulleted list of statements that are related to the content of this sentence. I want you to evaluate which of those statements is consistent with the original sentence. 
Only one of the statements is consistent. If more than one statement seems consistent, choose the best one. When you answer, you should generate only one sentence follow this format: 'The most consistent statement is 1. A increases B', responding by simply replicating the statement with the assigned number.

Note that roles for the relation (Subject as SUBJ, Object as OBJ) are assigned for each mention from a given pair. When you assume that there is an explicit direction for the relation, you should consider the direction from SUBJ to OBJ to make a final decision. Simply put, the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) can exist, while the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) can not. 
However, there are also bidirectional relation types like Interacts with, or (Positively/Negatively) Associated with. When you think the given entity pair has a bidirectional relation, then the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) and the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) could be the same depending on the situation.
Each entity mention in the given pair is surrounded by the role and type information in the form of '<[ROLE]_START=[TYPE]> MENTION <[ROLE]_END=[TYPE]>'. In [ROLE] slots, SUBJ and OBJ could be placed, whereas for [TYPE] slots, different entity types can be placed.

Also, note that lots of entity pairs do not have a certain relation type, so be sure to respond as ‘There is no relation between A and B’ if you cannot find any relation for the given entity pair.
