Please read carefully the following guideline for relation types and their descriptions. 

Note that roles for the relation (Subject as SUBJ, Object as OBJ) are assigned for each mention from a given pair. When you assume that there is an explicit direction for the relation based on the trigger information youâ€™ve found, you should consider the direction from SUBJ to OBJ to make a final decision. Simply put, the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) can exist, while the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) can not. 
However, there are also bidirectional relation types like Interacts with, or (Positively/Negatively) Associated with. When you think the given entity pair has a bidirectional relation, then the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) and the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) could be the same depending on the situation.
Each entity mention in the given pair is surrounded by the role and type information in the form of '<[ROLE]_START=[TYPE]> MENTION <[ROLE]_END=[TYPE]>'. In [ROLE] slots, SUBJ and OBJ could be placed, whereas for [TYPE] slots, different entity types can be placed.

Guideline (Relation types and their descriptions are provided)
- Interacts with: Acts, functions, or operates together with. The direction of the interaction may not be explicit.
- Increases: Make greater in size, amount, intensity, or degree. Similar to the definition of 'Interacts with', but the direction is explicit.
- Decreases: Make smaller in size, amount, intensity, or degree.
- Affects: Produces a direct effect on. The nature of the effect is not explicit.
- Improves: Enhances the quality, condition, or physiological process.
- Worsens: Diminishes the quality, condition, or physiological process.
- Causes: Brings about a condition or an effect. Implied here is that an Subject, such as for example, a pharmacologic substance or an organism, has brought about the effect.
- Predisposes: To be at risk for a disorder, condition. This suggests a susceptibility or tendency toward a specific state or response.
- Prevents: Stops, hinders or eliminates an action or condition.
- Associated with: An unspecified relationship, a correlation, etc.
- Positively associated with: Positive correlation. Different from the definition of 'Affects' in that the relationship is not direct.
- Negatively associated with: Negative correlation.
- Has component: Relation where one entity is a constituent part of another, like Nutrients, Chemicals in Food entity.
