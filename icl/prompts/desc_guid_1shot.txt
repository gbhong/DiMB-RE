Please read carefully the following guideline for relation types and their descriptions. 

Consider that the given example after each relation type in the Guideline explains how the relation type between the entity pair could be inferred. Please find the relation type based on the logical way the examples provide.

Note that roles for the relation (Subject as SUBJ, Object as OBJ) are assigned for each mention from a given pair. When you assume that there is an explicit direction for the relation based on the trigger information you’ve found, you should consider the direction from SUBJ to OBJ to make a final decision. Simply put, the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) can exist, while the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) can not. 
However, there are also bidirectional relation types like Interacts with, or (Positively/Negatively) Associated with. When you think the given entity pair has a bidirectional relation, then the relation between A (role: Subject) and B (role: Object) and the relation between B (role: Subject) and A (role: Object) could be the same depending on the situation.

Each entity mention in the given pair is surrounded by the role and type information in the form of '<[ROLE]_START=[TYPE]> MENTION <[ROLE]_END=[TYPE]>'. In [ROLE] slots, SUBJ and OBJ could be placed, whereas for [TYPE] slots, different entity types can be placed.

Guideline (Relation types and their descriptions are provided with examples)
- Interacts with: Acts, functions, or operates together with. The direction of the interaction may not be explicit.
<Example>
Sentence: Results suggested that GOS transport relies on a <SUBJ_START=Enzyme> permease <SUBJ_END=Enzyme> encoded by <OBJ_START=Gene> lacS <OBJ_END=Gene>, while a second unidentified protein may function as a galactoside transporter.
From the sentence above, the relation between 'permease' (role: Subject, type: Enzyme) and 'lacS' (role: Object, type: Gene) is ‘Interacts with’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘encoded’. In this context, it implies that the permease is involved with or functions together with the gene lacS in the process of GOS transport, which aligns with the definition of the relation type ‘Interacts with’. Also, the relation between 'permease' (role: Object, type: Enzyme) and 'lacS' (role: Subject, type: Gene) would also have the same relation type as the inferred relation is bidirectional.

- Increases: Make greater in size, amount, intensity, or degree. Similar to the definition of 'Interacts with', but the direction is explicit.
<Example>
Sentence: <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> Inulin <SUBJ_END=Nutrient> supplementation resulted in large increases in <OBJ_START=Microorganism> Bifidobacterium <OBJ_END=Microorganism> and Lachnospiraceae.
From the sentence above, the relation between 'Inulin' (role: Subject, type: Nutrient) and 'Bifidobacterium' (role: Object, type: Microorganism) is ‘Increases’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘increases’. In this context, it explicitly states that the presence or addition of Inulin leads to a greater amount of Bifidobacterium, indicating the 'Increases' relation.

- Decreases: Make smaller in size, amount, intensity, or degree.
<Example>
Sentence: Broilers fed diets supplemented with <SUBJ_START=Food> GS <SUBJ_END=Food> had lower levels of <OBJ_START=Chemical> plasma glucose <OBJ_END=Chemical> compared with the control birds.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘GS’ (role: Subject, type: Food) and ‘plasma glucose’ (role: Object, type: Chemical) is ‘Decreases’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘lower’. In this context, the presence of ‘GS’ (presumably a supplement or food) is associated with a reduction in the degree of ‘plasma glucose’ in broilers, indicating the 'Decreases' relation.

- Affects: Produces a direct effect on. The nature of the effect is not explicit.
<Example>
Sentence: The effect of a new <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> symbiotic formulation <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> on plasma levels and <OBJ_START=Physiology> peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression <OBJ_END=Physiology> of some pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with ulcerative colitis.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘symbiotic formulation’ (role: Subject, type: Nutrient) and ‘peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression’ (role: Object, type: Physiology) is ‘Affects’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘effect’. In this context, the new ‘symbiotic formulation’ has a direct effect on ‘peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines’. The nature of the effect is not explicitly mentioned, but it indicates that the symbiotic formulation influences or has an impact on this physiological aspect, aligning with the 'Affects' relation.

- Improves: Enhances the quality, condition, or physiological process.
<Example>
Sentence: <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> Resistant starch <SUBJ_END=Nutrient> can improve <OBJ_START=Physiology> insulin sensitivity <OBJ_END=Physiology> independently of the gut microbiota.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘Resistant starch’ (role: Subject, type: Nutrient) and ‘insulin sensitivity’ (role: Object, type: Physiology) is ‘Improves’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘improve’. In this context, ‘Resistant starch’ is associated with enhancing or improving ‘insulin sensitivity’, which is the physiological process, implying the ‘Improves’ relation type.

- Worsens: Diminishes the quality, condition, or physiological process.
<Example>
Sentence: <SUBJ_START=Physiology> Dietary fiber restriction <SUBJ_END=Physiology> presents obstacles to <OBJ_START=Physiology> appropriate defecation <OBJ_END=Physiology>.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘Dietary fiber restriction’ (role: Subject, type: Physiology) and ‘appropriate defecation’ (role: Object, type: Physiology) is ‘Worsens’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘presents obstacles’. In this context, ‘Dietary fiber restriction’ is associated with diminishing the quality or condition of ‘appropriate defecation’, indicating the 'Worsens' relation type.

- Causes: Brings about a condition or an effect. Implied here is that an Subject, such as for example, a pharmacologic substance or an organism, has brought about the effect.
<Example>
Sentence: Reflux was greater when subjects consumed <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> SCF <SUBJ_END=Nutrient> compared with <OBJ_START=Physiology> NFC <OBJ_END=Physiology>.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘SCF’ (role: Subject, type: Nutrient) and ‘Reflux’ (role:Object, type: Physiology) is ‘Causes’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘greater’. In this context, it is implied that the consumption of SCF brings about the condition of greater reflux. Therefore, the relation between ‘SCF’ and ‘Reflux’ is categorized as ‘Causes’ based on the mention of the greater effect.

- Predisposes: To be at risk for a disorder, condition. This suggests a susceptibility or tendency toward a specific state or response.
<Example>
Sentence: Dietary intake of inulin prevents <SUBJ_START=Physiology> preneoplastic changes <SUBJ_END=Physiology> and inflammation that promote <OBJ_START=Disease> colon cancer <OBJ_END=Disease> development.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘preneoplastic changes’ (role: Subject, type: Physiology) and ‘colon cancer’ (role:Object, type: Disease) is ‘Predisposes’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘promote’. In this context, it is implied that preneoplastic changes, if not prevented, may create a susceptibility or tendency toward the development of colon cancer. Therefore, the relation between ‘preneoplastic changes’ and ‘colon cancer’ is categorized as ‘Predisposes’ based on the mention of the promoting effect.

- Prevents: Stops, hinders or eliminates an action or condition.
<Example>
Sentence: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and <SUBJ_START=Nutrient> vitamin E <SUBJ_END=Nutrient> against <OBJ_START=Disease> liver dysfunction <OBJ_END=Disease>.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘vitamin E’ (role: Subject, type: Nutrient) and ‘liver dysfunction’ (role:Object, type: Disease) is ‘Prevents’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘protective’. In this context, vitamin E, along with UDCA, acts to prevent or hinder the occurrence of liver dysfunction. Therefore, the relation between ‘vitamin E’ and ‘liver dysfunction’ is categorized as ‘Prevents’ based on the mention of the protective effects.

- Associated with: An unspecified relationship, a correlation, etc.
<Example>
Sentence: Shifts in the abundance of <SUBJ_START=Microorganism> Eubacterium rectale <SUBJ_END=Microorganism> were associated with changes in the glucose and <OBJ_START=Physiology> insulin postprandial response <OBJ_END=Physiology>.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘Eubacterium rectale’ (role: Subject, type: Microorganism) and ‘insulin postprandial response’ (role: Object, type: Physiology) is ‘Associated with’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘associated’. In this context, though there exists a relationship between the abundance of Eubacterium rectale and changes in the insulin postprandial response, the relation is not specified in either positive or negative way. So, the relation could be categorized as ‘Associated with’. Also, the relation between ‘Eubacterium rectale’ (role: Object, type: Microorganism) and ‘insulin postprandial response’ (role: Subject, type: Physiology) would also have the same relation type as the relation is bidirectional.

- Positively associated with: Positive correlation. Different from the definition of 'Affects' in that the relationship is not direct.
<Example>
Sentence: <SUBJ_START=Microorganism> Enterobacteriaceae <SUBJ_END=Microorganism> was positively correlated with <OBJ_START=Metabolite> valeric acid <OBJ_END=Metabolite> concentrations.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘Enterobacteriaceae’ (role: Subject, type: Microorganism) and ‘valeric acid’ (role: Object, type: Metabolite) is ‘Positively associated with’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘positively correlated’. In this context, it is implied that there lies a positive correlation between the two entity mentions, but still there is no evidence that one could affect the other directly.

- Negatively associated with: Negative correlation.
<Example>
Sentence: <SUBJ_START=Microorganism> Ruminococcus <SUBJ_END=Microorganism> showed negative correlation with <OBJ_START=Chemical> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <OBJ_END=Chemical>.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘Ruminococcus’ (role: Subject, type: Microorganism) and ‘high-density lipoprotein cholesterol’ (role: Object, type: Chemical) is ‘Negatively associated with’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘negative correlation’. In this context, it is implied that there is a negative correlation between Ruminococcus and the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, there is no evidence provided that one directly affects the other.

- Has component: Relation where one entity is a constituent part of another, like Nutrients, Chemicals in Food entity.
<Example>
Sentence: Supplementation of <OBJ_START=Nutrient> psyllium <OBJ_END=Nutrient> to <SUBJ_START=Food> milk replacer <SUBJ_END=Food> increased fermentation in the colon.
From the sentence above, the relation between ‘milk replacer’ (role: Subject, type: Food) and ‘psyllium’ (role: Object, type: Nutrient) is ‘Has component’ because the relation is triggered by the mention ‘Supplementation’. Because the ‘psyllium’ is added to the milk replacer, we can find that the relation between 'milk replacer' and 'psyllium' is categorized as 'Has component' based on the mention of supplementation.
